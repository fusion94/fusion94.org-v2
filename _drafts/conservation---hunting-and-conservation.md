This is the second article in a series of articles that relate to various forms of Conservation.

> "I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land; but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us."

### Hunting and Conservation

> warning ""
> I will admit my views on Conservation are skewed, or if you will biased, as someone who actively hunts and fishes and I've been performing these activities for close to 45 years now.

In our nation's early years, there were few laws protecting fish and wildlife and our wildlife resources took a heavy toll. Market hunters took fish and wildlife **at will** while habitat disappeared under plow and roads, resulting in devastating reductions in wildlife populations. Some species, like the passenger pigeon, were taken to the point of no return; others such as bison, white-tailed deer and wild turkeys, were pushed to the edge extinction.

As the tides turned for conservation, important laws were passed, including the [Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918), the [Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Duck_Stamp), and the [Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingell%E2%80%93Johnson_Act). Collectively, these acts laid the foundation for what inspired the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation.

Across North America, hunting was a largely unregulated activity for individuals and commercial entities until the 1800's, when citizens began to ask whether wildlife populations could continue at healthy levels without checks on hunting. The legal framework that has since developed grew out of a set of principles now known as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation. Seven features make the North American model distinct.

1. **Wildlife is a public resource**. In the Unites States, wildlife is considered a public resource, independent of the land or water where wildlife may live. Government at various levels have a role in managing that resource on behalf of all citizens and to ensure the long-term sustainability of wildlife populations.
2. **Markets for game are eliminated**. Before wildlife protection laws were enacted, commercial operations decimated populations of many species. Making it illegal to buy and sell meat and parts of game and nongame species removed a huge threat to the survival of those species. A market in furbearers continues as a highly regulated activity, often to manage invasive wildlife.
3. **Allocation of wildlife by law**. Wildlife is a public resource managed by government. As a result, access to wildlife for hunting is through legal mechanisms such as set hunting seasons, bag limits, license requirements, etc.
4. **Wildlife can only be killed for a legitimate purpose**. Wildlife is a shared resource that must not be wasted. The law prohibits killing wildlife for frivolous reasons.This is a text with a footnote
5. **Wildlife is an international resource**. Some species, such as migratory This is a text with a footnotenal boundaries. Treaties such as the Migratory Bird Treaty and CITES recognize a shared responsibility to manage these species across national boundaries.
6. **Science is the proper tool for discharge of wildlife policy**. In order to manage wildlife as a shared resource fairly, objectively, and knowledgeably, decisions must be based on sound science such as annual waterfowl population surveys and the work of professional wildlife biologists.
7. **The democracy of hunting**. In keeping with democratic principles, government allocates access to wildlife without regard for wealth, prestige, or land ownership.

Carrying on the theme above here are 5 examples of how hunting is Conservation.

* In 1907, only 41,000 elk remained in North America. Thanks to the money and hard work invested by hunters to restore and conserve habitat, today there are more than 1 million.
* In 1900, only 500,000 whitetails remained. Thanks to conservation work spearheaded by hunters, today there are more than 32 million.
* In 1900, only 100,000 wild turkeys remained. Thanks to hunters, today there are over 7 million.
* In 1901, few ducks remained. Thanks to hunters’ efforts to restore and conserve wetlands, today there are more than 44 million.
* In 1950, only 12,000 pronghorn remained. Thanks to hunters, today there are more than 1.1 million.

The 5 species listed above were almost completely wiped out to to market hunting and really only came back due to the [Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittman%E2%80%93Robertson_Federal_Aid_in_Wildlife_Restoration_Act). This law, commonly referred to the Pittman-Robertson Act created an excise tax that provides funds to each state to manage such animals and their habitats.

The Pittman–Robertson Act took over a pre-existing 11% excise tax on firearms and ammunition. Instead of going into the U.S. Treasury as it had done in the past, the money is kept separate and is given to the Secretary of the Interior to distribute to the States. The Secretary determines how much to give to each state based on a formula that takes into account both the area of the state and its number of licensed hunters.

So how much money does this actually mean? Well here are the breakdowns for 2018[^1].

So in total, that's $1.15 billion dollars going directly back into conservation efforts from sportsmen in 2018. Which come to approximately $10 billion in spending by sportmen.

In comparison, in 2017 the Sierra Club received $68 million dollars in total contributions and spent $63 million dollars on program services. Essentially sportsmen from Michigan and North Carolina **combined** contributed the same amount as the Sierra Club in total. I'm not trying to paint the Sierra Club as a bad organization at all. Fundamentally there aren't bad. They just can't do enough.

Since the first annual apportionment of $890,000 in 1939 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the agency has distributed more than $21 billion from the two federal excise taxes for state conservation and recreation projects.

How can we as sportsmen increase that number? Well for one, if the excise tax provided by the Pittman-Robertson act was increased to 15% then that would raise the total amount to $1.5 billion annually. Seems pretty straight forward.

Buying licenses, stamps and tags to legally hunt or fish in America is an essential and necessary means to supporting wildlife conservation. However, we can do more to conserve fish, wildlife and their habitat to ensure the future of hunting and fishing for future generations. Alternatively there are other ways as sportsmen to support Conservation such as the 2% for Conservation movement/organization.
