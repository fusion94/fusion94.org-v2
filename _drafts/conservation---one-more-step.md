 A vote by the U.S. Houaw of Representatives on Tuesday supported a massive package of conservation and public access bills that permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund and advances other key measures, edging hunters, anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts closer to a hard-won and long-awaited victory.

This is the most sweeping conservation leglislation in over a decade, protecting millions of acres of land and hundreds of miles of wild rivers.

The **Natural Resources Management Act (S. 47)**[^1] encompasses the consensus priorities of sportsmen and women as well as a bipartisan cadre of senators who have worked to ensure the legislation’s survival. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s (R-AK) ongoing efforts that began last Congress paid off with today’s overwhelming 363-62 with 6 non-votes[^2] vote in support of the measure.
