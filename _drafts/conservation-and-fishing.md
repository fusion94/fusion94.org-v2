### Fishing and Conservation

> warning ""
> My views on Conservation have been formed by actively hunting, fishing, and spending time in the outdoors for close to 45 years now.

In a previous article I coverered the Pittman-Robertson Act and it's impact on [Conservation](http://localhost:4000/blog/2019-02-17/conservation-and-hunting/). I this article I will be covering the [Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingell%E2%80%93Johnson_Act). Taken together, these two acts laid the foundation for what inspired the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation.

The Dingell–Johnson Act (D-J), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance for state fish restoration and management plans and projects. It was modeled after the Pittman-Robertson Act, and was aimed at creating a similar program for the management, conservation, and restoration of fishery resources.

Funds to support the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration programs are received from excise taxes on fishing equipment, fish finders, motorboat fuels, small engine fuels, and import duties. State agencies that sell fishing licenses are the only entities eligible to receive grant funds. Each state’s share is based 60 percent on the number of it’s licensed anglers (fishermen) and 40 percent on the size of it’s land and water area.

Program funds are used by state fish and wildlife agencies for sport fish management, boating access, and aquatic education projects.

#### The Wallop-Breaux Amendment

Lots of amendments have been made over the years, but the biggest was in 1984. This was called the Wallop-Breaux Amendment, after Congressman John Breaux and Senator Malcolm Wallop, who led the charge. This amendment expanded the list of sport fishing gear that qualified for the 10% excise tax. It also added a 3% tax on certain motors and fish finders. In addition, it expanded the projects that the tax could fund to include boating facilities, education programs, and more.

The problem had been that the Pittman-Robertson Act in the hunting industry was blowing Dingell-Johnson out of the water in terms of money raised, more than twice as much. By extending the list of qualifying equipment, this amendment took the funding from $38 million to $122 million in one year.

### Is it Working?

So how has D-J worked out for the American public?

Getting fishery management right is incredibly complex, as illustrated by a history of failure in the United States that spanned decades. Those failures too often deprived saltwater anglers of abundant target stocks, removed local catch from restaurant menus and grocery stores, and created hardship for coastal communities. Yet it is increasingly clear that the United States has now built many of the laws, regulations and institutions needed to meet this complex challenge. If we stay the course, the dividends of our hard-won gains will only grow.

Take the Pacific groundfish fishery. The oceans off our nation’s West Coast have a rich marine biodiversity; and the groundfish fishery, encompassing more than 60 species of rockfish and over 90 species in total, is the region’s largest. Yet by 2000 it was declared a federal disaster, and imports rapidly displaced Pacific groundfish in the U.S. seafood marketplace. What followed was years of hard work by fishermen and other stakeholders – which included the imposition of science-based catch limits for every species, monitoring of every fishing vessel, and development of a new catch share management system that incentivized conservation. Now, the fishery is roaring back. This week’s report confirms that another three Pacific groundfish stocks – bocaccio, darkblotched rockfish and Pacific Ocean perch – have been rebuilt.

At a big-picture level, today’s report is another clear indication that “the state of our fisheries is strong.” Indeed, it reveals that in 2015 the Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI) – the composite index that tracks the health of key commercial and recreational stocks that account for 85% of total catch – hit an all-time high.

Since 2000 a total of 39 federal stocks that were once dangerously depleted by earlier management failures have been declared fully rebuilt. The new stocks reaching that milestone in 2015 were Petrale Sole and Canary Rockfish – two iconic West Coast groundfish species that are among many being revitalized under catch share management.

Yet since the turn of the 21st century, something remarkable has happened in United States waters. After decades of shrinking fish populations, some trends have begun to shift.

The number of overfished stocks in federally managed fisheries has dropped by two-thirds, from 92 in 2000, to 29 in 2015. Meanwhile, the tally of federally managed fish populations that have been rebuilt went from zero to 39.

An amendment in 2007 to the 30-year-old Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act marked a big departure from this. It mandated that by 2011 every federally managed fishery had to have a scientifically determined, legally enforced annual catch limit, and a management plan for how it would stick to it.

In the U.S., since 2000, there has been a 70 percent drop in the number of overfished species. The number of fish with rebuilt populations has risen from zero to 39. At the same time, the number of jobs in fishing has risen by 31 percent in the past three years while revenue has risen 44 percent.
