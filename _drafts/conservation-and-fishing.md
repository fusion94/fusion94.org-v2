### Fishing and Conservation

> warning ""
> My views on Conservation have been formed by actively hunting, fishing, and spending time in the outdoors for close to 45 years now.

In a previous article I coverered the Pittman-Robertson Act and it's impact on [Conservation](http://localhost:4000/blog/2019-02-17/conservation-and-hunting/). I this article I will be covering the [Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingell%E2%80%93Johnson_Act), the [1984 Wallop-Breaux Amendment](https://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/subpages/grantprograms/sfr/SFR_Act_Amend.htm) and the [Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson%E2%80%93Stevens_Fishery_Conservation_and_Management_Act) Taken together, these three acts laid the foundation for what inspired the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation with regards to Fishing (both commercial and sport).

#### Dingell-Johnson Act

The Dingell–Johnson Act (D-J), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance for state fish restoration and management plans and projects. It was modeled after the Pittman-Robertson Act, and was aimed at creating a similar program for the management, conservation, and restoration of fishery resources.

Funds to support the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration programs are received from excise taxes on fishing equipment, fish finders, motorboat fuels, small engine fuels, and import duties. State agencies that sell fishing licenses are the only entities eligible to receive grant funds. Each state’s share is based 60 percent on the number of it’s licensed anglers (fishermen) and 40 percent on the size of it’s land and water area.

Program funds are used by state fish and wildlife agencies for sport fish management, boating access, and aquatic education projects.

#### The Wallop-Breaux Amendment

Lots of amendments have been made over the years, but the biggest was in 1984. This was called the Wallop-Breaux Amendment, after Congressman John Breaux and Senator Malcolm Wallop, who led the charge. This amendment expanded the list of sport fishing gear that qualified for the 10% excise tax. It also added a 3% tax on certain motors and fish finders. In addition, it expanded the projects that the tax could fund to include boating facilities, education programs, and more.


* Created Aquatic Resources Trust Fund
* Provided for additional funds captured from a portion of the federal gasoline excise taxes attributable to motorboats by a formula based on boat registrations
* Broadened taxed items (fishing equipment)
* Added District of Columbia
* Authorized spending for aquatic education for up to 10% of apportionment
* Mandated 10% minimum of apportionment be spent for motorboat access
* Mandated apportionments be distributed between freshwater/marine
* Mandated "maintenance of effort"

The problem had been that the Pittman-Robertson Act in the hunting industry was blowing Dingell-Johnson out of the water in terms of money raised, more than twice as much. By extending the list of qualifying equipment, this amendment took the funding from $38 million to $122 million in one year.

#### Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act

The Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA), commonly referred to as the Magnuson–Stevens Act (MSA), is the legal provision for promoting optimal exploitation of U.S. coastal fisheries. Enacted in 1976, it has since been amended in line with sustainability policy.

The Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act[^1] is the primary law governing marine fisheries management in United States federal waters. The law is named after U.S. Senators Warren G. Magnuson of Washington state and Ted Stevens of Alaska.

[^1]: 16 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1884

The MSFCMA was enacted to promote the U.S. fishing industry's optimal exploitation of coastal fisheries by "consolidating control over territorial waters" and establishing eight regional councils to manage fish stocks. The act has been amended several times in response to continued overfishing of major stocks. The most recent version, authorized in 2007, includes seven purposes:

1. Acting to conserve fishery resources
1. Supporting enforcement of international fishing agreements
1. Promoting fishing in line with conservation principles
1. Providing for the implementation of fishery management plans (FMPs) which achieve optimal yield
1. Establishing Regional Fishery Management Councils to steward fishery resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revising of plans which (A) enable stake holders to participate in the administration of fisheries and (B) consider social and economic needs of states.
1. Developing underutilized fisheries
1. Protecting essential fish habitats

Additionally, the law calls for reducing bycatch and establishing fishery information monitoring systems.

### Is it Working?

So how has D-J worked out for the American public?

Since 1996, NOAA Fisheries has reported on the status of U.S. fisheries, as required by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Reporting on the status of fish stocks provides fisheries managers and the public with an account of how well current fisheries management measures are working. A scientific analysis of the abundance and composition of a fish stock (stock assessment) evaluates the stock against reference points. Stock assessments use the best information available, which may include data from fisheries landings, scientific surveys, and biological studies. NOAA Fisheries uses the stock assessment and reference points to determine whether the stock is subject to overfishing or overfished. Information from the stock assessment is used by the regional fishery management council to recommend the annual catch limit for the stock.

NOAA Fisheries’ Office of Sustainable Fisheries updates the status of fish stocks managed under federal fishery management plans quarterly based on stock assessments completed during that quarter. Stock status definitions include:

* Overfishing – The annual rate of catch is too high.
* Overfished – The population size is too small.
* Rebuilt – A previously overfished stock that has increased in abundance to the target population size that supports its maximum sustainable yield.

These data also help NOAA Fisheries calculate its Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI), which measures the performance of U.S. fish stocks selected for their importance to commercial and recreational fisheries.

#### Fish Stock Sustainability Index

NOAA Fisheries measures the performance of U.S. federal fisheries through the Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI). First implemented in 2005, the FSSI is a quarterly index that currently includes 199 fish stocks selected because of their importance to commercial and recreational fisheries. The FSSI measures the performance of these important fish stocks, which represent 85 percent of total catch.

The FSSI increases when NOAA Fisheries determines the status of a stock and when a stock's status improves (either no longer subject to overfishing, no longer overfished, biomass increases to at least 80 percent of target, or is rebuilt). The number of stocks in the index may be revised as new fisheries develop and stocks are assessed.

##### History of the FSSI

The original FSSI reported on 230 stocks managed under federal fishery management plans (FMPs), including domestic stocks we manage solely within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and international stocks we manage jointly under international agreements. We reported the original FSSI on a scale of 920 possible points which required a constant 230 stocks in the index. Over time, as fishery science and management evolved and stocks were both added to and removed from FMPs, maintaining exactly 230 stocks in the FSSI became an increasing challenge.

Beginning in 2015, we revised the FSSI so that the maximum possible FSSI score is 1,000, even if the number of stocks reported in the FSSI changes. This will allow the FSSI to accommodate future additions or removals of stocks to and from FMPs. We also removed international stocks from the FSSI. International stocks are subject to different management requirements than domestic stocks, and the impact of U.S. fisheries management to control overfishing or rebuild these stocks is often small or indirect. By focusing on domestic stocks, the FSSI is a stronger performance measure for U.S. fishery management.

##### FSSI Scoring Methodology

Each quarter, NOAA Fisheries calculates an FSSI score, incorporating information from new stock assessments and stock status determinations. The FSSI is calculated on a 1,000 point scale using the following methodology:

Step 1: Assign weighted criteria points for each stock based on the following:

| | |
|---|---|
|Criteria | Criteria Points|
|1. "Overfished" status is known.|0.5|
|2. "Overfishing" status is known.|0.5|
|3. Overfishing is not occurring (for stocks with known "overfishing" status).|1.0|
|4. Stock biomass is above the "overfished" level defined for the stock.|1.0|
|5. Stock biomass is at or above 80% of the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield (BMSY)*|1.0|

<div class="captions">
_* Stocks rebuilding from a previously overfished condition are not awarded the fourth point until they reach BMSY, as mandated by the Magnuson-Stevens Act. After they have been fully rebuilt, they may fluctuate within the 80% parameter and retain the score of 4 like the other non-rebuilding stocks. This point is in addition to the point awarded for being above the “overfished” level._
</div>

Step 2: Calculate the sum of criteria points for all FSSI stocks.

Step 3: Calculate maximum criteria points possible: multiply number of FSSI stocks (199) x maximum criteria points per stock (4 points).

Step 4: Calculate a raw total point score: divide sum of criteria points / maximum criteria points possible.

Step 5: Convert raw total point score to a 1,000 point scale: total raw point score*1,000.

### Other Bits

Getting fishery management right is incredibly complex, as illustrated by a history of failure in the United States that spanned decades. Those failures too often deprived saltwater anglers of abundant target stocks, removed local catch from restaurant menus and grocery stores, and created hardship for coastal communities. Yet it is increasingly clear that the United States has now built many of the laws, regulations and institutions needed to meet this complex challenge. If we stay the course, the dividends of our hard-won gains will only grow.

Take the Pacific groundfish fishery. The oceans off our nation’s West Coast have a rich marine biodiversity; and the groundfish fishery, encompassing more than 60 species of rockfish and over 90 species in total, is the region’s largest. Yet by 2000 it was declared a federal disaster, and imports rapidly displaced Pacific groundfish in the U.S. seafood marketplace. What followed was years of hard work by fishermen and other stakeholders – which included the imposition of science-based catch limits for every species, monitoring of every fishing vessel, and development of a new catch share management system that incentivized conservation. Now, the fishery is roaring back. This week’s report confirms that another three Pacific groundfish stocks – bocaccio, darkblotched rockfish and Pacific Ocean perch – have been rebuilt.

At a big-picture level, today’s report is another clear indication that “the state of our fisheries is strong.” Indeed, it reveals that in 2015 the Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI) – the composite index that tracks the health of key commercial and recreational stocks that account for 85% of total catch – hit an all-time high.

Since 2000 a total of 39 federal stocks that were once dangerously depleted by earlier management failures have been declared fully rebuilt. The new stocks reaching that milestone in 2015 were Petrale Sole and Canary Rockfish – two iconic West Coast groundfish species that are among many being revitalized under catch share management.

Yet since the turn of the 21st century, something remarkable has happened in United States waters. After decades of shrinking fish populations, some trends have begun to shift.

The number of overfished stocks in federally managed fisheries has dropped by two-thirds, from 92 in 2000, to 29 in 2015. Meanwhile, the tally of federally managed fish populations that have been rebuilt went from zero to 39.

An amendment in 2007 to the 30-year-old Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act marked a big departure from this. It mandated that by 2011 every federally managed fishery had to have a scientifically determined, legally enforced annual catch limit, and a management plan for how it would stick to it.

In the U.S., since 2000, there has been a 70 percent drop in the number of overfished species. The number of fish with rebuilt populations has risen from zero to 39. At the same time, the number of jobs in fishing has risen by 31 percent in the past three years while revenue has risen 44 percent.
