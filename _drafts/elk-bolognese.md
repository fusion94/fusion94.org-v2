Regardless of the season there isn’t much that warms a soul better than a big plate of pasta topped with a classic, slow-cooked [Bolognese Sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolognese_sauce). As with most wild game recipes, I have tweaked the classic just a bit to make it work with elk.

Since elk is leaner than the traditional mixture of ground beef chuck and ground pork in most Bolognese sauce recipes, I add a bit of fat in the form of diced bacon. The bacon itself breaks down during the relatively long cooking time, so you don’t really notice it in the final dish, but the flavor and texture the small amount of pork fat adds to the dish really helps.

### Ingredients

* 2 pounds ground elk
* 6-8 slices bacon (diced()
* 1 medium onion (finely chopped)
* 1 stalk celery (finely chopped)
* 1 large carrot (finely chopped)
* 1 shallot (finely chopped)
* 4 cloves garlic (minced)
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 cup beef broth
* 1 cup dry red wine
* 1 can (28 ounce) San Marzano tomatoes (crushed)
* 1-2 bay leaf
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon dried basil
* 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 cup whole milk or half and half
* 1 ½ pounds dry Tagliatelle pasta

Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano cheese for grating
