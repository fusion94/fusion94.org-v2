> “The medium of podcasting and the personal nature of it, the relationship you build with your listeners and the relationship they have with you—they could be just sitting there, chuckling and listening… there’s nothing like that.”

Now that the off-season is upon us, it's time to catch up on some podcasts.  listening to the following podcasts, which educate, entertain, and illuminate all things hunting.

Some episodes, however, take on a life of their own. They provide hunting insight, education, and a new take on old stories. Some dive off into psychedelic tangents, sure to entertain to the highest degree. If you’re gearing up for a long drive, a long day at work, or just want new listening material, get after these go-to episodes — listed in no particular order.

### Podcasts versus Audiobooks

A podcast is always episodic, meaning that it’s broken into successive episodes that are released on some kind of schedule, which is typically once a day, week, or month. The content itself can be whatever you want it to be — interviews, roundtables, news, advice, etc. — and this is why podcasts are often seen as “on-demand radio shows”. Most notably, you can subscribe to podcasts and get new episodes pushed to you as they’re made available.

An audiobook is a very specific type of content: singular recordings of pre-existing text. In other words, 99 percent of the time, an audiobook will also be available in non-audio form, and this is true whether it’s a novel, textbook, essay, etc. Audiobooks are never released in episodic chunks, meaning you can’t subscribe to an audiobook like you can with a podcast.

#### Podcasts Pros:

* They are more relaxing than audiobooks. When I’m listening to an audiobook, I want to focus enough so I don’t miss anything important. With podcasts, it’s less crucial to hear every word. Since I’m often listening after work or while doing the dishes at the end of a long day, I like being able to zone out every now and then without feeling as though I’ve lost a plot thread.
* They allow me to learn about more books. Most of the podcasts I listen to are bookish ones, including all the Book Riot ones, of course, and they have become an invaluable source of reading recommendations. I don’t want to miss out.
* They allow me to keep up with my favorite podcasters. Once I’ve listened to a podcaster long enough, he or she starts to feel like a companion. They aren’t friends, of course, because I don’t actually know these people, but over time I come to like the company of the people talking into my ears.
* They are free and available whenever I want them. Audiobooks are much trickier to find for free: yes, they are available at the library, but not always the ones I want to listen to and not always right away. If I want to listen to a particular audiobook at a particular time, it’s likely I’m going to have to pay in one way or another. Podcasts are much easier to come by.

#### Audiobooks Pros:

* They allow me to get through more books each year. In the past I didn’t count audiobooks in my yearly tally, as though listening to an audiobook isn’t really reading. But that’s silly, and now I add them in.
* They make it easier for me to try new kinds of books I might not otherwise try. I get many of my audiobooks through the library, so they are free and I feel no pressure to finish them. I read a greater variety of books this way, or at least I give a greater variety a chance to win me over.
* They make me laugh at, cry over, feel happy about, and generally have a stronger emotional response to books than print versions do. For me, reading print is a more cerebral experience, while audiobooks touch my heart.
* They add another layer to the reading experience with the presence of the narrator. Audiobook narrators become almost like another character, and the good ones make me want to spend more time in their company.

### The MeatEater Podcast

Hosted by author and TV show host Steven Rinella, this podcast is one of my favorites, as Steve and friends dive deep into discussions on outdoor adventures, hunting tactics & philosophy, fishing, wild game preparation and much more. For smart, intellectual and fascinating conversations related to hunting – this podcast can’t be beat.
