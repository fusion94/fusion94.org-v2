 Alternatively there are other ways as sportsmen to support Conservation such as the 2% for Conservation movement/organization.
 
### What is 2% for Conservation?

[2% for Conservation](https://fishandwildlife.org/) is a non-profit organization (501c3 non-profit) that certifies true conservationists. They believe businesses and individuals committed to giving at least 1% of their time and at least 1% of their money to conservation organizations deserve recognition. They also believe that more businesses and more people need to get involved in conservation to ensure the future existence of fish and wildlife. Their goal is to preserve our hunting and angling heritage and to promote the proper science based conservation of fish, wildlife and their habitat.

### The 2% for Conservation Loop

2% for Conservation was started out of necessity. Many things have changed since the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation was created over 80 years ago. Consumers are better educated about conservation issues and businesses understand the value of corporate responsibility. Hunters and anglers understand they can no longer take their favorite pastimes for granted and are increasingly dedicated to doing their part in ensuring the long-term viability of the natural environment they value so highly.

Through the mechanism provided by 2% for Conservation, connections are made and strengthened between businesses, conservation organizations, and consumers. The networks that result from this model will provide a continuous funding stream for conservation efforts and a valuable opportunity to educate the public about the important role that sportsmen and women play in conserving fish and wildlife.

Most importantly, the networks of businesses and individuals engaged in the 2% for Conservation model have a huge opportunity to spread the mission of conservation. It has never been more important for sportsmen and women to educate the public as to how hunters and anglers continue to fund, protect, and conserve fish and wildlife.

### So Exactly how does it work?

**Business Membership:** 2% for Conservation puts businesses through an audit process to certify that they give back at least 1% of their gross annual sales and at least 1% (21 hours) of volunteer time to conservation causes. Upon approval, business members become part of an exclusive network of philosophically aligned companies committed to ensuring the future of fish, wildlife, hunting and angling.

**Individual Certification:** Individuals can become certified “True Conservationists” by demonstrating their commitment to conservation by proving that they give back at least 1% of their annual income and volunteer at least 1% (21 hours) of their time to conservation causes.

**Do you volunteer at least 1% of your time to Conservation?**<br>
(~2,080 work hours/year = ~21 hours of volunteer time)

**Do you contribute at least 1% of your money to Conservation?**<br>
(i.e., $50,000 annual income *0.01 = $500)<br>
(i.e, $90 of annual membership(s) to conservation groups + $200 of raffle tickets at banquets + $150 of product from 2% Member Companies + $60 of silent auction items at banquets = $500 contributed to conservation)
