So this security camera footage was captured earlier this week approximately a 1/2 mile from my house.

### California Mountain Lions

More than half of California is mountain lion habitat. Mountain lions generally exist wherever deer are found. They are solitary and elusive, and their nature is to avoid humans.

Mountain lions primarily eat deer, but, if allowed, they will prey on vulnerable pets and livestock. In extremely rare cases, even people have fallen prey to mountain lions.

Mountain lions that threaten people are immediately killed. Those that prey on pets or livestock can be killed by a property owner after the required permit is secured. Moving problem mountain lions is not an option. It causes deadly territorial conflicts with other mountain lions already there. Or the relocated mountain lion returns.

### Living in Mountain Lion Country

* Acknowledge that you live in mountain lion country and make a commitment to educate yourself.  Talk to your neighbors and work together.
* Never feed deer or other wildlife; it is illegal to feed deer and other big game in California and it will attract mountain lions.
* Deer-proof your landscaping by avoiding plants that deer like to eat.
* Trim brush to reduce hiding places for mountain lions.
* Don’t leave small children or pets outside unattended.
* Install motion-sensitive lighting around the house.
* Provide sturdy, covered shelters for sheep, goats, and other vulnerable animals.
* Don’t allow pets outside when mountain lions are most active—dawn, dusk, and at night.
* Bring pet food inside to avoid attracting raccoons, opossums and other potential mountain lion prey.

### What to do if you Encounter a Mountain Lion

Mountain lions are quiet, solitary and elusive, and typically avoid people by nature. However, as human population expands into mountain lion habitat, more frequent sightings may occur and human/mountain lion encounters may increase.

Mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare. However, attacks have occurred in California. Understanding mountain lion behavior and how to act responsibly in mountain lion country may greatly reduce potential conflict with these majestic animals.

The following safety information is a compilation taken from wildlife managers, wildlife officers and scientists that study mountain lion behavior. Although no strategy in the event of an encounter is guaranteed to be successful in every situation, these tips will help keep you safe in lion country.
