The wonder is that, with the present state of knowledge and the experiences gained, no attempt is being made to disturb the electrostatic or magnetic condition of the earth, and transmit, if nothing else, intelligence."

CB radios experienced a sudden burst of fame - or infamy - during the late 1970s, with a string of movies such as "[Smokey and the Bandit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076729/)" and "[Convoy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077369/)" along with a string of television shows such as "[The Dukes of Hazzard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078607/)" and
"[Movin' On](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071012/)".

Today, CB radio service is largely defunct (other than for truckers), but new types of radio services - notably FRS - provide similar or better service for individuals and families wanting a convenient way to keep in contact over relatively short distances.

In this first part of a new series on personal radio services, I'll explain the different types of radio service available to you. In the second part I'll discuss the theory of what determines the effective range of these radios. In the third part I'll test out CB, FRS and GMRS radios and tell you which services give the best range and convenience.

### Introduction

Personal radio services are short-range, low-power radio communications using devices that operate much like walkie-talkies. Personal radio services include one- and two-way voice services, data services and remote-control transmissions that operate equipment.

Personal radio services devices generally do not rely on transmission towers or other equipment. Some types, especially those using VHF and UHF radio spectrum, encounter significantly less static, noise and fading than CBs or walkie-talkies.

The most popular types of personal radio services are Citizens Band Radio Service, Family Radio Service, General Mobile Radio Service, Low-Power Radio Service and Multi-Use Radio Service. Of these types of services, only General Mobile Radio Service requires an FCC license to operate.

#### Citizens Band Radio Service (CB)

* CB service allows private, two-way radio communications.
* CB service operates on 40 shared channels on a "take-turns" basis, meaning no CB channel is assigned to any specific individual or organization. Users must never talk with another station for more than 5 minutes continuously, and must wait at least one minute before starting another communication.
* CB equipment used in the United States must be FCC-certified and labeled as such by the manufacturer.
* You may not raise the power output of your CB unit, attach any type of power amplifier or modify the unit internally. The maximum authorized power levels vary depending on whether the station is transmitting a single side band (up to twelve watts Peak Envelope Power (PEP)) or an AM signal (up to four watts PEP.) Communications (or attempts to communicate) with stations over 250 km (155.3 miles) away are prohibited.

#### Family Radio Service (FRS)

* FRS allows two-way voice communications over short distances (generally less than one-half mile on the 0.5 watt channels and up to two miles on the 2 watt channels, depending on conditions).
* An FRS unit looks and works much like a walkie-talkie.
* In 2017, the Commission designated additional channels for FRS use and reclassified certain dual-use FRS-General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) units as FRS-only units for which no individual license is needed. A GMRS license is still needed to operate with more than 2 watts ERP; to operate on frequencies 467.5500, 467.5750, 467.6000, 467.6250, 467.6500, 467.6750, 467.7000, and 467.7250 MHz; or to use a detachable antenna.
* You can operate your FRS unit anywhere in the U.S. and its possessions.

#### General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)

* GMRS is a land-mobile radio service available for short-distance, two-way communications.
* A GMRS system may legally be operated only with an FCC license. The individual licensee is responsible for the proper operation of the GMRS system.
* A GMRS system is made up of station operators and a mobile station consisting of one or more mobile units. It may also include one or more land stations. Some land stations operate as repeaters, thereby extending the range of GMRS mobile units.
* New GMRS licenses are granted only to individuals, but GMRS licenses granted to non-individuals (such as businesses) before July 31, 1987, can be renewed if certain conditions are met. You can apply for a GMRS license online, or by filing FCC Form 605. The FCC sets license filing fees annually, and licenses are granted for 10 years.

#### Low Power Radio Service (LPRS)

* LPRS is a private, one-way short-distance communication service that allows stations to transmit voice data or signals for auditory assistance to people with disabilities, people who require language translation, and certain individuals in educational settings. LPRS also allows stations to transmit voice, data, or tracking signals for health care-related communications and certain law enforcement activities. Two-way communications are prohibited. LPRS can also be used for network control communications in the Automated Marine Telecommunications System (AMTS).
* LPRS transmitters can be operated anywhere in the United States.

#### Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS)

* MURS is a private, two-way short-distance voice or data radio communications service.
* The service operates on five VHF channels. MURS users must cooperate in using the five channels to reduce interference to other users. No user has priority over any other user, but all users must yield to emergency communications. A MURS station may not operate as a repeater station, including store-and-forward packet radio operation, or a signal booster.
* Maximum allowable output power for a MURS unit is two watts. Transmission range between two hand-held units varies depending on the unit's antenna height, terrain and weather.

> Be aware that if you operate a radio transmitter that requires a license, or use a radio that is authorized for only a specific service for an unauthorized service, you may be fined or imprisoned, and/or the equipment may be confiscated.

### Typical Uses for these types of radios

All these different types of radio services are intended to be used for short range communications - typically of no more than a mile or two. If you are with other family members at a Shopping Mall, or at some type of Outdoors Event, in theory these radios will enable you to all keep in touch with each other.

The radios can also be helpful if you are traveling with friends in two (or more) cars. You can easily keep in contact if you get separated (as long as not too much distance gets between you), and discuss where you'll stop and plan for turns and get in the correct lane in plenty of time.

These radio services are unlimited and free (except for the need to buy an annual license for GMRS) and work anywhere without the need to use cellphone type external transmitting towers or other equipment. This can make it very convenient whenever you want quick easy short range communications.

With the possible exception of CB, none of these services work over anything other than very short range. CB sometimes reaches out as far as 10-15 miles (and in special circumstances, can travel hundreds of miles).
