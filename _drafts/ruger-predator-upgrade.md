### Introduction
Ruger came out with their low cost American line of rifles a few years ago. It was about a year after their introduction that they announced a new model in their American Rifle lineup called the Predator, which featured a “heavier” weight barrel that was even threaded for a suppressor or muzzlebrake, all at a very low cost.

So several months ago I picked up a [Ruger American Predator](https://ruger.com/products/americanRiflePredator/specSheets/26973.html) chambered in 6.5 Creedmmor.

### Rifle Specifications
Here are the basic specs:

* Barrel Length: 22 inches. 1:8”RH Twist. 5/8”x24 Muzzle Threads
* Overall Length: 42 inches
* Length of Pull: 13.75 inches
* Trigger Pull: Ruger Marksman Adjustable Trigger™
* The rifle tested measured 3# 6.5oz from the factory
* Capacity: Detachable AICS Magazine: 3+1
* Weight: 6.6 Pounds
* Stock: Lightweight synthetic with Power Bedding® integral bedding block system and soft rubber recoil pad. Also includes sling swivel studs.
* Sights: None. Comes with factory installed rail.

### 6.5 Creedmoor Background
The 6.5mm Creedmoor, designated 6.5 Creedmoor is a centerfire rifle cartridge introduced by Hornady in 2007 as a modification of the .30 TC, which was based on the .308 Winchester. It was developed in partnership by Hornady Senior Ballistics Scientist, Dave Emary and Dennis DeMille, the VP of product development for Creedmoor Sports, hence the name.

The cartridge was designed specifically for long-range target shooting although it is also achieving success in game hunting. Bullet for bullet, the 6.5mm Creedmoor achieves a slower muzzle velocity than longer cartridges such as the 6.5-284 Norma or magnum cartridges such as the 6.5mm Remington Magnum. However, due to its overall length of 2.825 inches (71.8 mm), it is capable of being chambered in short-action bolt-action rifles and AR-10 semi-automatic rifles.

Here we arrive at the allure of 6.5 mm-rifle bullets. The ability for a particular cartridge to shoot flat is a result of its muzzle velocity and the aerodynamics of the bullet. Thirty-caliber bullets can be made to shoot just as flat as 6.5 mm bullets, but in order for this to be achieved, the bullet has to be quite long, and it has to be pushed to higher velocities than the .308 Win. is capable.

This means longer, heavier bullets need a longer action, and it means recoil is increased. The redneck explanation is that 6.5 mm bullets offer the best balance of flat trajectory and tolerable recoil in sport-rifle cartridges, due to their high-ballistic coefficient (BC).

To illustrate how this all sorts out downrange, we can compare Hornady’s flattest-shooting 6.5 Creedmoor load to its flattest-shooting .308 Win. load at 800 yards, using Hornady’s 4DOF ballistic calculator.

In summary the Creedmoor shoots flatter, hits harder, does not drift as much and kicks less. And that, my friends, is kind of a big deal.

**6.5 Creedmoor vs .308 Winchester**

| Load      | Velocity | Energy | Drop | Drift | Time of Flight | Recoil |
| --------- |:--------:|:---:|:----:|:-----:|:---:|:------:|
| Hornady 140-grain ELD 6.5 Creedmoor | 2,710 | 856 | 20.99 | 4.53 | 1.124 | 9.92 |
| Hornady 178-grain ELD-X .308 Winchester | 2,600 | 833 | 24.81 | 5.76 | 1.234 | 13.09 |

> Velocity measured in fps 10 feet from the muzzle for 10 consecutive shots with a PACT Chronograph XP. Energy at 800 yards measured in ft-lbs. Drop is the elevation correction in MOA needed at 800 yards, with a 10-mph and 9--degree crosswind. Time of Flight to 800 yards measured in seconds. Recoil (Recoil Force) measured in ft-lbs based on a total rifle weigh of 10 pounds.

### My Review
Since I purchased it I've installed a scope, gone to the range twice with it and went hunting with it once. Here are my basic thoughts in regards to it.

Now there's nothing inherently wrong with the rifle as is. It's a simple rifle, an accurate rifle and an affordable rifle. For the price I paid for it it's not been a bad rifle at all although there are a few things I wasn't a fan of. As such I decided to do a few upgrades to fix these shortcomings.

Great optics are worth every penny and [Vortex Optics](http://vortexoptics.com/) makes some of the best out there. [Nightforce](http://nightforceoptics.com/) also makes some pretty great scopes out there but they don't make binoculars whereas Vortex does and they also makes laser range finders. Overall Vortex allows for "one stop shopping".

Here's a picture of the rifle with the scope installed.

So the biggest issue I had with the rifle was with the molded polymer stock. While it is light weight it really feels cheap, The trigger guard is also molded into the stock and there's no way to relace it. At the bottom of the pistol grip there is a plastic cap with the Ruger logo on it. It provides no functional use and appears to be nothing more than brand marketing.

Here are a few pictures.

Lastly I was not a fan of the stock bolt knob.
