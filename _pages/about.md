# Background

My name is Tony Guntharp and I make things. Software or Hardware, it doesn’t matter. I’m OCD, a Geek, a Homebrewer. Fan of Open Source, Linux, OSX and Mobile. Purveyor of Craft Beer and Single Malt Scotches. <del>Avid Motorcyclist and</del> Porsche 911 Owner.

I Spent 10 years of my life jumping out of airplanes for the US Army doing high speed/low drag shit. Combat Veteran.

I'm also a conservationist and a hunter.

I was one of the Co-Founders of [SourceForge.net](http://sf.net).

I've been at [Google](https://about.google/) since 2015, currently working as the [Site Reliability Manager](https://landing.google.com/sre/) for the Carrier-SRE-MTV team. Most of our focus is in the area of carrier related services including [Rich Communication Services (RCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services), SMS Aggregation and anything else related to mobile messaging.

I am (or was) a core developer/contributor for the following Open Source Projects:

### Philosophy

I’m a big believer in [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services). As such you’ll find quite a bit of of my work released under a variety of Open Source licenses over at [GitHub](http://github.com).
