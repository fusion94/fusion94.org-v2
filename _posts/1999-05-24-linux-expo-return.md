So I've returned from Linux Expo. It was a fairly decent experience as I got to meet up with Stephen Tweedie who is one of the authors of the ext2 file system. He pointed me in the right direction as far as Matisse Porting goes.

I also got to meet <a href="http://dibona.com">Chris DiBona</a> and <a href="http://occy.net">Trae McCombs</a> while at the show. They are both employees of <a href="http://varesearch.com">VA Research</a> and are both pretty cool.

After the show ended Mondhipa and I spent a few days out on the Outer Banks doing tourist like things and having a good time. The lighthouses there are pretty amazing.
