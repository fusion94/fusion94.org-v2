I've had a job offer out from <a href="http://varesearch.com">VA Research</a> now ever since Linux Expo and I've decided to take it. I'll be starting on Monday June 14th and I'm pretty excited about the whole deal.

It's a great opportunity to work on the linux operating system full time and there are some really smart people there.
