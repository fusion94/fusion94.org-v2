So what was once "Cold Storage" is now <a href="http://sf.net">SourceForge</a> and is now available for public consumption. So what is <a href="http://sf.net">SourceForge</a>? Well it's a web resource for Open Source projects and organizations. We're providing CVS, mailing lists, public forums, the ability to poll visitors and project members, bug tracking and anonymous FTP for all open source projects to anyone completely free of charge.

I encourage anyone that's involved in an open source project to stop by and try it out.

Big thanks go out to Larry Augustin, Tim Perdue, Drew Streib, and Uriah Welcome for making this happen.
