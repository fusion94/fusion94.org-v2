So I'm at The Bazaar in New York City and there's a lot of talk about <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. Emmett Plant has written a <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/storage/1999121800219PS">story</a> about it over at <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/">Linux Today</a>.

Thanks Emmett.
