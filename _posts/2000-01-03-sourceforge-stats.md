Well here are some rough <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> stats after about 6 weeks.

* 700+ Projects

* 3,000+ Developers

Those developers are spread over 76 countries so these stats just helps prove how <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> can help manage a distributed software project.

The growth and acceptance are far more than we expected and anticipated so it's very exciting.
