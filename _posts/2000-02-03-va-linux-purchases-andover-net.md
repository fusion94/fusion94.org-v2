Well here I am at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo (LWCE) here in New York City and the news just broke that my employer, <a href="http://valinux.com">VA Linux Systems</a>a has just purchased <a href="http://andover.net/">Andover.Net</a>.

So what does this mean? Honestly...I have no idea other than what the above statement says. I know of no plans to merger Server51 with <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. Nor is <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> planning to merge with <a href="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a> or <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.

So don't ask me.
