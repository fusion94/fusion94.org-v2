So we're proud to announce the availability of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docs/compile_farm">SourceForge Compile Farm</a>. This service is going to allow open source developers to test their projects and how well it compiles on both Linux and *BSD systems that they might not normally have access to.

It's something that we've wanted to do for a long time and just now got around to getting it implemented.
