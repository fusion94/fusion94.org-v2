We're pleased to announce that SourceForge now has IA-64 (Itanium) machines available to use in the compile farm.

There are a few requirements such as a NDA, no benchmarking (or at least publicy stating the numbers), the project must be open source, and access has to go through an approval process. That is the overview that we've come up with and we hope that this will go a long way in finding out any IA-64 issues that your code may have. This will also be good for developers in checking the IA-64 Linux Kernel out in real world conditions.
