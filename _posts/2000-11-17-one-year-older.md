<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> is now officially one year old. It's been both an amazing and a bumpy ride over the past year as we've experienced growth spurts that has effected our scalability. I can remember when we released it at Comdex last year that we thought (and publicly stated) that we'd consider it a success if we hit 200 projects and 1,000 developers in the first year of service. Boy were we ever wrong. We hit that in the first 45 days and the project has been bigger than we ever expected or anticipated.

Big thanks out to the open source community for all of your support.
