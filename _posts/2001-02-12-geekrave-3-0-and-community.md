GeekRave 3.0 at the Commodore Ballroom up in Vancouver kicked ass. Got to meet sellout & mux from #e. San was the headlining DJ and pics of the event can be found here. San's Latest CD has been ripped to mp3 and is available for download from the files section. Be forewarned that it's a 134MB tarball as a single mp3 ripped at 256. Also included is the playlist.
