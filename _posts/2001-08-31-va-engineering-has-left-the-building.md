So today was the last day of Hardware/Software Engineering at <a href="http://valinux.com">VA Linux Systems</a>. A decision was made awhile back to exit the hardware business altogether so we all became dead weight to the company. This was not new news for those of us in engineering but it's still a difficult pill to swallow.

This is the first time I've ever had to experience a layoff so it was especially difficult for me. On the upside was that the severance package that was offered was very very generous and that's going to help in the transition.

Working at VA was a once in a lifetime experience. I don't think that I'll ever get the opportunity to work with a team of such dedicated, talented and brilliant engineers ever again and that does in fact weigh heavily upon me.

Anyways I'm rambling now. Time to take a break from work and other things and see what lies over the horizon.
