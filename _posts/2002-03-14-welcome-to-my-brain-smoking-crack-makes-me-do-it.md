2001 is finally over. Thank God. For those that didnt know, 2001 was a banner year for me. Lets see... I got laid off from VA Linux Systems in September. Then my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Sounds like fun doesnt it ? No worries though, VA was getting to the point where it wasnt a great place to work and my mother is on the road to recovery.

I appreciate everyone who has sent emails and notes regarding my mothers health if I forgot to respond to you I'm sorry about that.

The job situation is startng to look up for me at the moment, I have two really promising things to follow up on this week and one of them will pan out.

One other thing, this is a new design, Boris has been bitching about it so I changed it.

So Boris: Sod off you wanker.
