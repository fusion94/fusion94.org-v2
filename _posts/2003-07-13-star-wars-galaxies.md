So I've been having framerate issues with Star Wars Galaxies. It's a beautiful game and constantly getting 3-9 fps has really sucked ass. I spent some time doing some searching and found a fix. While not ideal it does allow me to get 20-30 fps.

The trick is to turn of AntiAliasing and Anisotropic Filtering in your video card settings. Also turn off vertex and pixel shaders in the SWG client.
