So about a month ago I bought a new Road Bike in an effort to get back in somewhat decent shape and to drop 25 pounds or so. I bought a KHS Flite 500.

Here are the specs:

Frame: Reynolds Double Butted, Full Chromoly
Fork: Full Carbon Fiber
Rims: Neuvation Radials
Hubs (F/R): Neuvation Radials
Tires: Vittoria Zaffiro, 700x23c
Spokes: Neuvation Radials 14G Stainless, Black
Deraileur, Front: Shimano Sora
Deraileur, Rear: Shimano Tiagra
Shifters: Shimano Tiagra STI
Saddle: Selle Italia XO-SUDO
Handlebar: TTT
Stem: TTT
Brake Levers: Shimano Tiagra
Frame Size: 60cm
Weight: 22.3 lbs

It looks like <a href="/images/khs-bike.jpg">this</a>.
