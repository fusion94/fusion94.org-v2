After years of having to hand edit the html/php that powered my personal website I've decided to give Movable Type a try.

Installation was fairly straightforward on a Redhat 9 server. The biggest pain in the butt so far has been with editing the styles sheet to get something I somewhat liked. I finally wrangled it into something I can live with for now.
