My relationship with <a href="http://www.anarchyonline.com/">Anarchy Online</a> has truly been a love/hate relationship.

I beta-tested the primary release and played at least 3-4 hours a day for the first year. After that first year Funcom still had major issues with the game and as most of my friends that had played AO were leaving I hung up my spurs so to speak.

After they released the first expansion pack <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/notumwars/">The Notum Wars</a> I tried to play again but just couldn't generate any real interest to continue playing. So once more I hung up the proverbial spurs.

Recently Funcom released the second expansion pack for AO called <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/shadowlands/">Shadowlands</a>. With this expansion pack Funcom has generated enough interest (with the new playfields, professions and perks system) for me to play for another couple of months.

I've rolled up a Keeper (Idotychides) whose already Level 35 and plan on rolling up a Shade (name undetermined as of yet) as soon as the Keeper hits Level 50. I also need to get my Level 76 Fixer (Rimshot) up to 100.

Anyways, that's enough rambling for now about AO.
