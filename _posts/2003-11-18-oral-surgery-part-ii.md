Well it was far less painful than I imagined. Actually there was no pain at
all. After spending an hour and a half waiting the whole procedure took about 5
minutes. Typical isn't it. Plus I can't drink coffee for a couple of hours. So
if I bite your head off today I'm sorry....it's the lack of caffeine. Now I get
to spend the next week or two worried about things such as Bone Spicules (sharp
bone edges), abscess, maxillary sinus troubles, and dry sockets.

Joy Joy.

I'll write more later today but for now I think I'll rest.
