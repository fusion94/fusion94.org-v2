Just random bits of cruftiness......

I feel much better today. I was afraid that I was going to be useless for a couple of days afer the Surgery but I haven't had any issues at all related to it. This is very good and unexpected to be quiet honest. I'm even back to eating normal foods today.

So <a href=""http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> just released 2 new Macs. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">20" Imac</a> in all it's sweetness, and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">Dual 1.8ghz G5</a>. I was considering the middle of the road G5 for the house but now have to rethink things with the addition on the 20" Imac. Decisions...Decisions.

Also to note is that there's a <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/news.php?id=242">rumour</a> over on <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/">Apple Insider</a> that talks about a dual G4 Powerbook. This will probably happen right after I purchase a new Powerbook to replace this First-Generation that I use daily.

In other areas of news is anyone really suprised that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/19/jackson.ranch/index.html">Michael Jackson faces multiple counts of child molestation</a> ? I mean for god's sakes....this isn't really news is it ?

Also to note is that <a href="http://www.sco.com/">SCO</a> <a href="http://www.atnewyork.com/news/article.php/3110981">plans to extend it's lawsuit to the BSD community</a>. The company has also had to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/2003/Nov/11192003/business/112207.asp">hire bodyguards</a> to protect it's executive management team.

Lastly for the night is that <a href="http://dibona.org">Chris DiBona</a> (one of the other founders of <a href="http://damagestudios.com">Damage Studios</a>) has released another <a href="http://rekonstruction.com/topics.html?topic=2192">update</a> to the <a href="http://rekonstruction.com">Rekonstruction</a> Backstory. Give it a read if you get a chance. Also we should be converting all the mailman archives over to a RSS feed in the very near future.
