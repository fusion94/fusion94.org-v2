So everyones favorite CEO, Darl McBride, has posted an <a href="http://www.sco.com/copyright/">"open letter"</a> in which he states that the <a href="http://www.sco.com">The SCO Group</a> believes that the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">GPL</a>, under which Linux is distributed, violates the United States Constitution and the U.S. copyright and patent laws. I'm really not sure exactly what he's been smoking but I wish he'd pass the pipe. After all the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">GPL</a> is based on the notion of intellectual property and firmly rests on Copyright law. Lately everytime Mr. McBride opens his mouth he shows the rest of the world just how much of a <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/">Microsoft Sycophant</a> he really is. As always...you can find out more about this at <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/">Groklaw</a>

Maybe we should be equipping our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/all/news/news_6084935.html">Xbox's</a>. It's gotta be easier to hump than their current gear.

In response to above said <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/">Microsoft Sycophant</a>, I located this <a href=http://www.xvsxp.com/articles/031124-thurott.shtml">rebuttal</a>. It's a good read.
