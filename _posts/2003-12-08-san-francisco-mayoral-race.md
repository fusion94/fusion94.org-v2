So the runoff for the San Francisco Mayoral Race is tomorrow. I'll be voting for <a href="http://www.gavinnewsom.com/">Gavin Newsom</a> even though Al Gore, Diane Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson all are endorsing him. This is surely a sign that I'm a very bad <a href="http://www.gop.com/">Republican</a>.
