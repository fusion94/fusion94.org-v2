So I wake up yesterday morning and I see <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/12/11/sprj.irq.contracts/index.html">this</a>. Can I tell you that it really made my day ?? France and Germany ?? HAHAHAHAHAHAH you lose suckers. Fucking morons. What did they honestly expect ?? Haven't they ever heard of "To the victors go the spoils of war" ? Well France hasn't as they haven't had a military victory. Ever.  It's funny as it appears that the World Trade Organization (WTO) will not declare the move illegal. I really think that this could get nasty but regardless I think it's funny as hell.
