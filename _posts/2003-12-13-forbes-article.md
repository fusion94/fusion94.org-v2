So awhile back (5 months or so) Erika Brown over at <a href="http://www.forbes.com">Forbes</a> interviewed <a href="http://www.dibona.com">Chris DiBona</a> and I about the <a href="http://www.damagestudios.com">Game Development Studio</a> we started. It came out in the December 22nd 2003 Issue that's on newstands now. Here's a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/1222/128.html">link</a> to the online version. Registration is required but it is free. Overall it's a good article. Some of the "facts" about us were in fact wrong but somehow, even after going over it with the Forbes Fact Checker these "facts" found their way into the story. No worries.
