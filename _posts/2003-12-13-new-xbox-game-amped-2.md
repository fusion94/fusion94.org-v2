So yesterday while at <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com">Best Buy</a>, while waiting for <a href="http://cingular.com">Cingular</a> to transfer over my old cell phone number over to my new phone I got a chance to play <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/amped2/default.htm">Amped 2</a> on one of the <a href="http://www.xbox.com">Xbox</a> demo stations located within the store. I liked it so much I bought it. So far I've really enjoyed playing it and have moved up from being ranked 250 in the world to 216. It's getting to the point now where it's actually fairly difficult to put enough tricks together to gain any serious points. No points...No advancement. Anyways, if you liked or like <a href="http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssx3/home.jsp">SSX3</a> then you'll enjoy this title as well.
