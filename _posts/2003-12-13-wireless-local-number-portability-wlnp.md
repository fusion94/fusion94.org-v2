Thank You Federal Communications Commission. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/NumberPortability/">Wireless Local Number Portability Mandate</a> I've dropped <a href="http://sprintpcs.com">SprintPCS</a> and have moved over to <a href="http://www.cingular.com">Cingular</a>. My number remains the same and was able to get a neat new phone as part of the switchover. I picked up a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/us/spg.jsp?page=start&Redir=template%3DPS1%26B%3Die%26PID%3D10076%26LM%3DPSM_V%26gal%3D105">Sony Ericsson T616</a>. So far it's pretty sweet. The only major drawback I've seen so far is that entering contacts via the phone interface sucks. I'm going to have either buy a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Powerbook</a> or buy a bluetooth card for my existing ti-book.
