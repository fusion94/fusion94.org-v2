As a kid I vastly enjoyed the game choplifter. Imagine my suprise when I located an updated version of it called <a href="http://www.majicjungle.co.nz/chopper.html">Chopper</a>. It's currently for OSX and completely free (well for now at least).

I also looked around and found a similar game called <a href="http://www.strangeflavour.com/games.html">Bushfire</a>. Download both and go have fun.
