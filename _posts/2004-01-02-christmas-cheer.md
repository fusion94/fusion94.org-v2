Oddly enough I got pretty much everything I wanted. It was really too much to be quite honest but what can you do.

The big winner was in fact my DVD Collection as I got <ul><li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/">Shogun</a>
</li><li><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0275140">Law & Order - Criminal Intent - The First Year</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203259/">Law & Order - Special Victims Unit - The First Year</a>
</li></ul>

That's about 50 hours worth of goodness.
