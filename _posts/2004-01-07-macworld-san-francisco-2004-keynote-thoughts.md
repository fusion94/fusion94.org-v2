The new iLife 04 suite looks especially sweet. Unfortunately for me I have a new Powerbook already so I'm going to have to purchase it. I think that GarageBand is worth the $49 though. I'm not sure about purchasing the JamPack/Keyboard though. My nieces and nephews could probably make use of it so perhaps I will pick them up. Everything else Steve talked about/showed was nice but not really relevant to me.
