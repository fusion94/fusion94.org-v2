It's always good news when OS X gets a couple of popular PC Titles ported to it. Yesterday <a href="http://www.aspyr.com">Aspyr</a> announced that they'll be publishing <a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/22752">Call of Duty</a> and <a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/22813">Black Hawk Down</a>. Looks like the release dates are in April/May Time frame.

Also to note is that <a href="http://www.aspyr.com/games.php/mac/scel/">Splinter Cell</a> is currently in Alpha and hopefully will be released later this month.
