Just wanted to mention a couple of other OS X Applications I'm using.

The first one is <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mysoftware/">DVD Cache</a> and it's what I use to maintain and organize my DVD Collection. It's shareware but well worth the $20.

The other App is <a href="http://ranchero.com/tigerlaunch/">Tiger Launch</a>. An easy-to-use and easy-to-configure application launcher for OS X that displays an Apps menu at the top of your screen listing all your applications in alphabetical order no matter what folder they appear in. It's completely free and was developed by the same team that brought us <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire & NetNewsWire Lite</a>.
