So after MacWorld yesterday I went down to the TechTV studios with <a href="http://www.dibona.com">Chris</a> and watched them do <a href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/index.html/">The Screen Savers</a> Program. Chris talked about recompiling the Linux Kernel and they plugged <a href="http://www.rekonstruction.com">Rekonstruction</a>. It was fairly interesting to say the least. The studio was way smaller than I imagined. All in all it was a good experience.
