So I've been trying out <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">Ecto</a> internally here now for a couple of days. Now that I have a handle on it I think I'll start using it instead of the Movable Type Web Interface. Not that there's anything wrong with the MT method but this is a bit faster and a bit more to my liking.

Now listening in iTunes:  <strong>I Want You To Want Me</strong> from the album At Budokan by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Cheap Trick%22">Cheap Trick</a><br /><br />
