<i>Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns &#8212; the ones we don't know we don't know." &#8212;Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld</i>

The paragraph makes sense....it's logical....so politics aside is he a linguistic genius or out of his skull ?
