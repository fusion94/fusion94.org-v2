So I picked up a paintbrush again earlier this week after a long layoff. I finished something that I actually like for once. It's acrylic on canvas 2.5'x2'. I've decided for no particular reason to call it Joss.

Now listening in iTunes:  <strong>Rock Me</strong> from the album Liz Phair by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Liz Phair%22">Liz Phair</a><br><br>
