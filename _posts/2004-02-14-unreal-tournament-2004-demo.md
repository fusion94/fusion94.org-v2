is out for the Mac now. You can grab a copy of it <a href="http://www.macgamefiles.com/">here</a>. After giving it a run or two on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html">17" Powerbook</a> all i can say is "Holy Crap". I had thought that it wouldn't play as well as Halo does but it's performance is noticeably better. Can't wait until they release and ship the full version.
