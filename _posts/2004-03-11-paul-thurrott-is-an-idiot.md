From his WinInfo Site:

"The moderate security flaw for MSN Messenger 6.1 and MSN Messenger 6.0 could let attackers view--but not change or download--files on the victim's computer. Microsoft will fix the flaw in an upcoming version of the Instant Messaging (IM) application the company plans to issue."

I know that Paul is just quoting the Microsoft Bulletin verbatim but as someone who calls himself a "technology reporter" he should actually grow some balls and mention that 'any flaw in any software application that allows an attacker to view any file on the target computer' is MORE that a moderate security flaw. What a fucktard. I find it amusing that he rails on OSX and Linux while preaching about how great Windows products are yet fails to mention any of their shortcomings. I use all 3 operating systems and while OSX is my favourite by far I'll criticize it if it's warranted.

As Kucharo said: "what a git"
