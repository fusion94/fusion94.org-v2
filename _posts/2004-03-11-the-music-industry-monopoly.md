The rock band Korn just came out with a great music video about the major label monopoly and radio consolidation. Korn plays a concert in a record store, while trashing the record store.
<p>
Things to note:
<p>
 The first words flashed during the video are "Music Monopoly?," followed by "One corporation owns the 5 major video channels in the U.S." and the question "Is that OK?"
<p>
 Statistics follow &#8212; "Last year, the big 5 record labels sold about $25 billion of music" and "90% of releases on a major label do not make a profit" &#8212; before it takes a stab at glossy videos, noting, "Britney Spears' last video cost $1,000,000," followed by "This Korn video cost $150,000" and, a few seconds later, "You have now seen $48,000 worth of video."
<p>
 Later, amid more record-store thrashing and footage of Davis singing (Jonathan Davis, Korn's lead singer), the video claims: "The music 'industry' releases 100 songs per week," "Only 4 songs are added to the average radio 'playlist' each week" and "Hit songs on Top 40 are often repeated over 100 times per week." Then it asks, "Is that all you want to hear?"
<p>
 It goes on to point out "Two radio conglomerates control 42% of listeners," "90% of all singles get to the 'hook' within 20 seconds" and "98 % of all #1 singles are less than 3 minutes and 30 seconds long" &#8212; "Does this seem like a formula to you?"
