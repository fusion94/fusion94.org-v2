In February Funcom announced that they were working on a new expansion pack to <a href="http://anarchyonline.com">Anarchy Online</a> called <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/alieninvasion/">Alien Invasion</a>. It looked like there was going to be some pretty cool content added like player built towns, player run shops, etc etc.

Well it sounds even better now. If you like AO or just want to know more go read the <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/499/499168p1.html">Interview</a> with AO's Game Director Marius Enge over at IGN.
