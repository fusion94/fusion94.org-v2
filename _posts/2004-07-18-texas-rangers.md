Went to a Texas Rangers ballgame tonight. First time at a Rangers game (in texas as i saw them play the giants out in california years ago) since I was a child. The new ballpark (which is actually 10 years old) is really nice. Not as nice as PacBell Park but a hell of alot nicer than the old ballpark here.

Rangers won in the 8th inning when Mark Texiera hit a grandslam homerun. Also to note that this was the first time I had been to a Rangers game that they actually won.
