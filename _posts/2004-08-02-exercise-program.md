So I joined a gym today. After several years of sitting behind a desk it's time for me to get back into the shape I was in when I was in the military. Or as close as I can considering the shape of my knees.

Part of the gym membership is working with a personal trainer to determine my bodyfat percentage and then determining my goals. Then working out a plan to lower my bodyfat percentage and meet my goals. Biggest thing is the dietary restrictions which is probably going to be the most difficult for me. Anyways I'll be charting my progress here.
