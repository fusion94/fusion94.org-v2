So I had my initial assesment with my trainer at the gym today. I'm at 240 pounds which is a bit overweight for my height according to the charts. My bodyfat % was at 24% though. Which was lower than I thought it would be and within normal range for my age.

My goal remains the same though. Drop the weight down to 220 to 225 pounds and get by bodyfat % down to under 15%. It shouldn't be all that difficult but time will tell.
