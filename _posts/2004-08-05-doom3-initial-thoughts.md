All I can say about Doom3 so far is "Holy Crap".

Everything about this game is absolutely beautiful. From the texture mapping to the unbelievable lighting to the sounds. It absolutely rocks.

If you don't have this yet you should run out and get it. This is far and away the most visually stunning game I have ever experienced.
