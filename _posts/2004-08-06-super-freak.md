So the original funk soul brotha Rick "Super Freak" James <a target="new" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/06/rick.james/index.html">died</a> today. Let's just take a moment of silence to remember the King of funk.

Ok moment is over....other than one or two songs Rick James sucked. I'll bet that <a target="new" href="http://www.zeruch.blogspot.com">Arruda</a> likes him though.
