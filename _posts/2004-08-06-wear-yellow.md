So my <a target="new" href="http://www.wearyellow.com">"LIVE<b>STRONG</b>"</a> bands came in today. I only ordered them about a month ago.

If you aren't familar with them they are yellow silicone wristbands engraved with Lance Armstrong's mantra and are being sold to help raise $5 million for the <a target="new" href="http://www.laf.org">Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF)</a>. If you have a chance pop on over to check them out and help fight cancer.
