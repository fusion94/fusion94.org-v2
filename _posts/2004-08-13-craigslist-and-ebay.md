So it looks as though <a target="new" href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a> now <a target="new" href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20040813005094&newsLang=en">owns approximately 25%</a> of <a target="new" href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>.

I don't really know how I feel about this. Ebay didn't screw up Paypal and hopefully they won't screw up Craigslist as well. Only time will tell.
