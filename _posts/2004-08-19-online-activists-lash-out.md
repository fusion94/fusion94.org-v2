So a group of online-activists (I refuse to call them hackers) are planning an online protest during the Republican National Convention.

They are providing scripts that will target GOP sites with Denial of Service attacks. This for the most part is very stupid in my opinion. These people refer to themselves as "hackers" yet are providing tools that destroy the very heart of Hacking. Free Speech and Freedom of Expression. Worse is the fact that they are doing it under an umbrella of secrecy.

Over the next couple of days I'll be modifying the tools that they are providing to not target the GOP websites but their very own websites.

Stay Tuned.
