5 years ago today we (<a href="http://precision.org">Uriah</a>, <a href="http://dtype.org">Drew</a>, <a href="http://perdue.net">Tim</a> and <a href="http://fusion94.org">I</a>) unveiled <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> to the world. It's hard to believe that it's been 5 years already as it seems like yesterday that we were crammed into our conference room over on Bordeaux banging on hardware and software and thinking ... <em>"no way is this launching at comdex"</em>. Well we did and the rest is history.
