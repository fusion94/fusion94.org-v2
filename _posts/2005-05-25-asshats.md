I swear to god some of the people (i.e. clients) I have to deal with while in the course of executing my job are complete asshats.

I've never seen such a collective group of dysfunctional losers in my life. For the most part to a man (or woman as the case may be) they are complete whackjobs in dire need of 2 to the back of the head.

Someone hire me and take me away from these morons. Please.
