So...I've played all the Medal of Honor Series of games in both multi-player and single-player mode and have loved every one of them.

Well EA released MoH - Pacific Assault back on Nov. 9th of 2004 and I had pre-ordered it but had yet to install/play it until last night and can I just say wow. It's even better than the European Theater versions of the game. The graphics are far superior and the gameplay (at least in single-player mode) is even better.

If you haven't tried it you can download a demo of it <a href="http://www.eagames.com/official/moh/pacassault/us/home.jsp">here</a>

Have fun!
