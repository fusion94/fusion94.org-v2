So I've been using GMail for some time now (email me at fusion94 there if you need/want an invite) and love it.

Anyways, I've just located <a href="http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm">this</a> which is a Shell Namespace Extension that creates a virtual filesystem around your Google GMail account, allowing you to use GMail as a storage medium.

It's pretty cool and can be quite helpful if you don't have access to a FTP server.
