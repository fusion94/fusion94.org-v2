Well I have a new job finally. I wasn't actively pursuing anything new but an opportunity came up that in all reality was too good to pass up. So on Monday, June 6th I'll be starting as a Senior Software Engineer for <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a>. I'll fill you in more on what I'll be doing after I return from San Francisco next week.
