So Actors (who are already getting paid approx. $275 an hour for game voice overs) are authorizing a strike until they get a pay increase and they want residuals as well. To that I say piss off. You come in spend maybe 10 hours on the game and you walk away with $2,750 or so. That's plenty fair. Believe it or not....unlike movies the work you do in games <b> ISN'T ESSENTIAL</b>. The coding and art and music is what matters. Not your cheesy voice over. So get over yourselves.
