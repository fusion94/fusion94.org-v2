So I made it back home to Texas today and neither my Central Air Conditioning was fixed nor did Comcast resolve my high speed internet issue.

After 2.5 hours on the phone with Comcast I finally got them to admit that the issue might in fact be with the cable modem and I was able to go into the local Comcast store and get a replacement. Brought it home, got the MAC address registered and bingo...high speed internet works. See Edgar....I told you it wasn't an issue with my hub. Moron.

I was also able to get my AC unit fixed so at some point during the night the temperature should be somewhat decent inside.
