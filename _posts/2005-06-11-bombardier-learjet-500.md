So a friend of mine that I've known 20+ years had extra tickets tonight to the <a href="http://www.indycar.com/home.php">Bombardier Learjet 500 Indy Car</a> race out at the <a href="http://www.texasmotorspeedway.com/">Texas Motor Speedway</a>. This was my second Indy Car race out at the speedway and was just as cool as the first.

The race started out with the crew from <a href="http://www.orangecountychoppers.com">OCC</a> unveiling a new chopper for Learjet. After that was done Paul Sr. gave the "gentlemen start your engines" command and he and Paul Jr. led the pace laps on choppers. Once the race started it was rather slow with 37 caution laps out of the first 70 laps. Then everyone got settled down and ran like hell. In the end Tomas Scheckter held on and ended up beating out Sam Hornish Jr. by 1/2 a car length.

Overall it was a fun way to spend the evening. I wasn't able to get any photos of the event but I've got photos from last years race on a hard drive somewhere and I'll pull them out of storage soon.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>
Photos from last year's event can be located <a href="http://fusion94.org/Galleries/IRL_Chevy_500/">here</a>.
