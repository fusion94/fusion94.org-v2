So I saw <a href="http://www.proce55ing.net/">Processing</a> not too long ago and found it quite interesting. From the website:

<i>"Processing is a programming language and environment for people who want to program images, animation, and sound. It is used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and hobbyists for learning, prototyping, and production. It is created to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context and to serve as a software sketchbook and professional production tool. Processing is developed by artists and designers as an open-source alternative to commercial software tools in the same domain."</i>

It's pretty cool and there are downloads available for most platforms.

If you like that you should also go give <a href="http://www.flong.com/yellowtail/">Yellowtail</a> a try.
