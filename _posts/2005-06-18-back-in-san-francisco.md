So I'm back in SF from the 20th up until the afternoon of the 25th. It's going to be nice to be in a cooler climate for a week as my central a/c unit hasn't been working properly and it's been rather hot here in Texas.

I'll be at the Feedster offices all week so if you know me then you have my cell and give me a call (Yes Arruda & Kucharo that means you).
