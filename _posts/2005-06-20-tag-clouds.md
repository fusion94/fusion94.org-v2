Ok I wrote a quick and dirty tag cloud this weekend that appears to work with Movable Type. I'm going to play around with it some more this week and will release the code while I'm in San Francisco. I also need to probably install <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com">Brad Choate's</a> <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/articles/brad_choate_on_.html">MT Plugin for tags</a> as well.
