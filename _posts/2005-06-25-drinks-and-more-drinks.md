So I headed over to <a href="http://bitsplitter.net/blog/">MikeR's</a> (also a fellow Feedster employee) last night for some drinks and a hacking/general BS session.

<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell Beattie</a> showed up with his <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008512.html">Elmo EV-400AF Visual Presenter</a> and showed it off. It's hella cool.

Seni (I know I probably just killed that...sorry) also showed up and showed us <a href="http://www.gefilter.com/gefilter.html"> Gefilter Fish</a> a Collaborative Event Planner that he's been working on. It's also pretty cool so go give it a spin.
