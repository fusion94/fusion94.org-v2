For those keeping track...I'm back in Dallas for at least the next week perhaps two.

This last trip to SF was very productive as <a href="http://bitsplitter.net/blog">MikeR</a> and I were able to hunt down and squash an issue with our advertising system. We also spent some time on designing some additional features that needs to be added to the advertising system. We start work on implementing those features on Monday.

<a href="http://feedster.com">Work</a> is also making is very difficult (in a good way) for me to stay in Texas. I haven't agreed to anything just yet but I am going to actually look at moving back to California. (and oh yeah, we've also crossed the 10 Million Indexed Feeds barrier)
