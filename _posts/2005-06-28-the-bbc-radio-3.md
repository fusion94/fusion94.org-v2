I've been meaning to mention this for some time but every time I think about making an entry something comes up.

Anyways the BBC Radio 3 is releasing all nine of Beethoven's symphonies for free as performed by the BBC Philharmonic in Manchester and conducted by Gianandrea Noseda.

You can download the files over at the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/beethoven/downloads.shtml">BBC-Radio3 Site</a>.

The downside is that they are only available for download for 7 days after the original performance airs and the BBC has a fairly strict disclaimer as to what you can and cannot do with the files. So if you're missing a few of the performances just send me a ping.
