sucks. I can't even begin to express how angry <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-funeral28jun28,1,4816654.story?coll=la-headlines-nation">this</a> makes me. Especially as one who has spent time in Group.

If I ever see these people protesting/picketing at a funeral of someone I know then there will be bloodshed. That I can assure you.
