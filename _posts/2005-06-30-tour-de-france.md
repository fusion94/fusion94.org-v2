So the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2005/TDF/LIVE/us/-10000/r1_avantcourse.html">Tour </a>opens Saturday with an 11.8-mile time trial, then rolls along for about 2,230 more grueling miles before concluding July 24 in Paris.

Coverage in North America is going to be provided by OLN once more and you can look at their schedule <a href="http://www.olntv.com/htmlpage.asp?htmlid=24">here</a>.
