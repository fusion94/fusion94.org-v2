Screw <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=5868">Leland Yee</a>. He's a moron.

At first, it was nothing more than a rumour. A "sex mini-game" in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, left in the code for the PC version and unlocked by inquisitive players. Then, as more and more information became available it seemed as though the sex game might be real.

The original d/l site is super hosed. Get the movie <a href="http://fusion94.org/Movies/hotcoffee.wmv">here</a>. Enjoy!
