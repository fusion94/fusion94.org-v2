So about 2 weeks ago I mentioned that we'd been busting our butts at work to release some new features. Many people know that part of what we do in the insertion of advertisements into feeds. We've done this for a few bigger publishers such as <a href="http://www.ostg.com">OSTG</a> and <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com">AlwaysOn</a>.

We've made some considerable changes to the system lately and we're currently beta-testing the insertion of advertisements into the feeds of smaller publishers. Soon we'll be opening up to the world at large for any Publisher, Blogger or anyone else with a feed to monetize your feeds through targeted advertising.
