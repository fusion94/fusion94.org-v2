There's an great story up over at ESPN located <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=nen">here</a>, about closer Robb Nen. He was an amazing closer for the Giants and it's too bad that he never got the opportunity to pitch again after the 2002 World Series. He was a warrior and I know that for the past few years that the Giants have missed having him available.
