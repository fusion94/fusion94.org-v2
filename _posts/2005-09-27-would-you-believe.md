Comedian Don Adams who portrayed the bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart has died. CNN has more about it <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/26/obit.adams.ap/index.html">here</a>. This was another TV show that I grew up with (as well as <a href="http://fusion94.org/archives/2005/09/little_buddy.html">Gilligan's Island</a>) and it's sad to see another comedic genius of this genre pass on.
