So I rolled into SF on Sunday. The movers picked up my stuff on Thursday and I bolted on Friday. 29 hours driving time from Dallas to SF. It's one hell of a drive that I hope I never make again.

So my stuff should be here in the next 16 days or so and at the end of the month I have to fly back to Texas to finalize the closing out of my house there but then I'm done.

Adios Dallas......you shithole.
