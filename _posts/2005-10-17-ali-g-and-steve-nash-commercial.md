So the Ali G & Steve Nash commercial on TNT about the upcoming NBA season is funny as hell. I'll paraphrase it.

"We're here with Steve Nash who was last season's MP3."
"No, I was the MVP."
"MP3."
"No I was the MVP"
"MP3."
"MVP."
"Whatever, you're Canadian, you don't even speak English."
"We speak English in Canada."
"You were the MP3."

I laughed my ass off. If anyone has a link to it please provide.
