The SCI FI Channel has officially renewed its hit series Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis for another season, the network has just announced. It will be SG-1's tenth season and fifth year on SCI FI, bringing it even with its five years on Showtime.

Season Ten will make Stargate SG-1 the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history, surpassing the nine years and 202 episodes of The X-Files. The series will air its remarkable 200th episode early in Season Ten.

I already own the first 8 seasons of Stargate SG-1 on DVD and look forward to purchasing Seasons 9 & 10 when they become available. I also believe that SG-1 is one of the best science fiction series to ever air on US television followed closely by the Battlestar Galactica series and Stargate Atlantis.
