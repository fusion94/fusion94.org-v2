<blockquote>Voters approved ballot measures to ban handguns in San Francisco and urge the city's public high schools and college campuses to keep out military recruiters Tuesday.

Measure H prohibits the manufacture and sale of all firearms and ammunition in the city, and make it illegal for residents to keep handguns in their homes or businesses.

Supervisor Chris Daly, who proposed the measure, said the victory showed that "San Francisco voters support sensible gun control."</blockquote>

Sensible gun control ?? An outright ban isn't sensible gun control it's an overreaction. Sensible gun control involves responsible ownership. To do this you ensure that the weapons are registered and that the registered owner of said weapon has received some degree of training.

To put this is some perspective I'm going to quote some rather obscure laws that kind of apply.
<blockquote>
Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons
11 November 1938

With a basis in &sect;31 of the Weapons Law of 18 March 1938 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p.265), Article III of the Law on the Reunification of Austria with Germany of 13 March 1938 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 237), and &sect;9 of the F&uuml;hrer and Chancellor's decree on the administration of the Sudeten-German districts of 1 October 1938 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p 1331) are the following ordered:

&sect;1
Jews (&sect;5 of the First Regulations of the German Citizenship Law of 14 November 1935, Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 1333) are prohibited from acquiring, possessing, and carrying firearms and ammunition, as well as truncheons or stabbing weapons.  Those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over to the local police authority.

&sect;2
Firearms and ammunition found in a Jew's possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation.

&sect;3
The Minister of the Interior may make exceptions to the Prohibition in &sect;1 for Jews who are foreign nationals.  He can entrust other authorities with this power.

&sect;4
Whoever willfully or negligently violates the provisions of &sect;1 will be punished with imprisonment and a fine.  In especially severe cases of deliberate violations, the punishment is imprisonment in a penitentiary for up to five years.

&sect;5
For the implementation of this regulation, the Minister of the Interior waives the necessary legal and administrative provisions.

&sect;6
This regulation is valid in the state of Austria and in the Sudeten-German districts.

Now I'm not calling Chris Daly a Nazi. Not yet. He's just a moron.

(**UPDATED BELOW**)

Here are a few more quotes and thoughts about this.

<blockquote>"This is putting a Band-Aid on heart surgery," said Gary P. Delagnes, president of the San Francisco Police Officer's Association. He called it another "silly idea" from elected officials whose progressive ideas are not grounded in the realities of fighting crime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If a criminal wants to get a gun outside of the county, clearly he can," Mr. Daly said. But "if we're able to limit the number of handguns in circulation in San Francisco, we can take a handgun out of some of these situations where there are homicides."

Mr. Daly, a self-described far-left progressive, quipped of his critics: "I know I'm crazy, but they're crazier than I am."</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Italian criminologist Cesare Beccaria wrote in 1764: "The laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Today, for the fisrt time in history we have total gun control, Our people are safer, Our police are safer, And our country is safer"

Adolf Hitler Chancellor
State of the Nation Address - October 23, 1939
Berlin, Germany</blockquote>

So Chris Daly admits that he's crazy. Who the hell voted for this guy? Also to help put this into perspective there is precisely one gun store located within the confines of the city and county of San Francisco.

The only other 2 cities in the US that have enacted such laws are the cities of Chicago and Washington DC.

According to crime statistics for 2002 in cities with a population greater than 500,000 the cities of Chicago and Washington DC rank as #5 and #1 as highest homicide rate per 100,000 people.

<table width="400">
<tr><td>CITY</td><td>PER 100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>(1) Washington, DC</td><td>45.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>(5) Chicago</td><td>22.2</td></tr>
</table>

San Francisco came in at 7.3 per 100,000.

A few years ago in an effort to combat homelessness within the city the Board of Supervisors decided that giving every homeless person a $400 a month stipend was an effective way to reduce the number of homeless people within San Francisco. Needless to say they were shocked when the homeless problem actually increased. In a few years from now I'm willing to bet that Measure H will in fact have increased San Francisco's Homicide rate and the Board of Supervisors will be standing around with their heads and thumbs up the asses going "what the hell happened?".
