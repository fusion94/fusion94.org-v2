Apple has now added select NBC programs to its TV lineup on the iTunes Music Store. From the press release: "NBC Universal programming now available on the iTunes Music Store spans from the 1950s to the present, including NBC's "Law & Order," "The Office," "Surface," "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno," "Late Night with Conan O'Brien," the USA Network's Emmy Award-winning "Monk" and Sci-Fi Channel's "Battlestar Galactica" as well as classic TV shows including "Alfred Hitchcock Presents," "Dragnet," "Adam-12" and "Knight Rider".

The press release also mentions that over 3 million videos have been downloaded from the ITMS in the past 2 months. Now is that TV Shows and Music VIdeos ?? Regardless it's a crapload of video.
