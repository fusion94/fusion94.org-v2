So after a bit of testing I've now left Movable Type and have made the switch over to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. The transition over was fairly easy and I'm loving the fact that it's in php and not perl. Over the next few days I've got to go over every post and Tag them properly and write some additional content but come 2006 I should have everything done.
