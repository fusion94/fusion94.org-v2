I've been at work since 4:00am and when I went to park my car in the garage at 5:45am there was probably already 400+ people in line outside Moscone waiting for the doors to open for Job's Keynote address. Crazy people.

Of course I was at work at 4:00am so perhaps I'd be better off questioning my own sanity.
