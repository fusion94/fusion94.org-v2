One of the issue's I've had for awhile now is synchronization of my firefox bookmarks across multiple computers. Luckily for me I've just located <a href="http://www.foxcloud.com/wiki/Main_Page">Foxmarks</a>.

<a href="http://www.foxcloud.com/wiki/Main_Page">Foxmarks</a> is an extension for Firefox that synchronizes bookmarks across multiple machines and so far is working perfectly for me.

You can download it from <a href="http://www.foxcloud.com/wiki/Foxmarks:_Getting_Started">here</a>.

You should also give the <a href="http://blog.foxcloud.com/">Foxcloud Blog</a> a read as well.
