So last Sunday I went out to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/alcatraz/">Alcatraz Island</a> with Nicole and <a href="http://ruled.net">Jaded</a>. It was my first trip to the rock after living here 10 years and I found it to be quite fun and interesting. The weather was excellent for San Francisco in January and I recommend the trip to anyone.

Jaded also took pictures which are located <a href="http://g2.ruled.net/v/Holidays/SanFrancisco/Alcatraz/">here</a>.
