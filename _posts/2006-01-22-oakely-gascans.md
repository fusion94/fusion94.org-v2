I've been missing my <a href="http://oakley.com/o/o1274d">Oakley Juliet Plasma/Fire Iridium</a> for a few months now. I have no idea what happened to them (but I do have a few ideas) and I've been going nuts without them.

So yesterday I bit the bullet and purchased a pair of <a href="http://oakley.com/o/o2222d">Oakley Gascans</a>. So far I really like them and they are great for those of us with huge noggins.

Here's what they look like:

And here are the specs:

    * Optically precise Polaric ellipsoid shield lens design for minimal distortion
    * Lightweight and durable O Matter® frame
    * Plutonite® lenses exceed ANSI Z87.1 standards for optical performance
    * 100% UV protection
    * Patented XYZ Optics® design
    * Distinctly squared Oakley metal icon accents at temples
    * Specially woven, electro-static storage bag included
    * Sized to fit and flatter medium to large faces
