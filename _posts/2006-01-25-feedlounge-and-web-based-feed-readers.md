Well I've heard good things about <a href="http://feedlounge.com/">Feedlounge</a> for some time now and finally took the "3 hour tour". One of the issues I've had for awhile is that I use both a laptop and a desktop during the workday and synchronizing feed subscriptions has been a pain. I've tried to use <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and I've found the interface to be very clunky. I also met one of the founders of <a href="http://gritwire.com">Gritwire</a> at the Syndicate Conference back in December and while I like what they are doing I found their interface to be equally clunky but in a different way than Bloglines.

So it was with much <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cynicism">cynicism</a> that I tried Feedlounge. I should have known better as it was developed by <a href="http://dotnot.org/blog/">Scott Sanders</a> and <a href="http://www.alexking.org/">Alex King</a>. I should have known better. Feedlounge is head and shoulders above all other web based feed readers that I've evaluated. It has a <a href="http://feedlounge.com/features/">wealth of features</a> and the layout is very familar as well as customizable.

So far it's the best web based feed reader that I've seen and I think that anyone that's had issues with keeping their feed readers in sync should consider purchasing a subscription. I thought so much of it that I went ahead and bought a <a href="http://feedlounge.com/register/">subscription</a>.
