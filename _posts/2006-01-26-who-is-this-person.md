I did some consulting work this week for <a href="http://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a> and then saw that <a href="http://www.spideysenses.com/">Ted Rheingold</a> has released <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1912&application=firefox">Who is this Person?</a> which is a Firefox extension.

From the description: <em>Highlight any name and request matches in LinkedIn, Wikipedia, Technorati, Yahoo Person Search, Google News, TailRank and more.</em>

It's pretty cool.
