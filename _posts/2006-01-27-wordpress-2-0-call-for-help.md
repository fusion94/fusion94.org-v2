So <a href="http://photomatt.net">Matt</a> has put out a <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/01/help-out/">call for help</a> in the development process of WordPress. If you can put in a few hours a month or whatever please <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities">sign up to assist</a>. Not everyone's a developer but there are spots for testing/QA available.
