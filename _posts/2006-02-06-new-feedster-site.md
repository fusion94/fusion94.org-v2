So about an hour ago the new <a href="http://feedster.com">Feedster</a> site launched. So what's new you may be asking...for starters there's an all new "look and feel". The core search has also been changed to speed up search queries. There's also a cleaner search API that's going to make querying our search database and index much easier and cleaner.

For example, if you want to query for the term "apple" and sort by date you can send the  string <em><a href="http://www.feedster.com/search/apple">"http://www.feedster.com/search/apple"</a></em> in your browser and get the results. If you wanted to get the same results as XML you'd send <em><a href="http://www.feedster.com/search/type/rss/apple">"http://www.feedster.com/search/type/rss/apple"</a></em>
to your browser.

There are still a few things that are being worked out but we're proud to have gotten this out.

Big thanks go out to Clay, Alan, Jeff, Brent, Chris and everyone else that participated in making this happen.
