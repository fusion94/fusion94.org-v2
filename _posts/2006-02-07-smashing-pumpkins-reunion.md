From <a href="http://CMJ.com">CMJ.com</a>: <em>“Though no official, Corgan-sanctioned announcement has been made, news is trickling in from different sources confirming that Smashing Pumpkins are indeed reuniting this spring.”</em>

This to me is very good news as the Smashing Pumpkins are probably my all time favorite band. I've got every album they've ever done so I hope that this is in fact not a rumour.
