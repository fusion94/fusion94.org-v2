According to <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/08/macbook-pro-availability-changes-to-3-4-weeks/">this article</a> over at <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">TUAW</a> it looks as though the MacBook Pro shipping/delivery dates might be slipping.

So I log onto the Apple Store and find that Order number XXXXXXXXX has this data:

Estimated Shipped By: Feb 15, 2006
Estimated Delivered By: Feb 23, 2006

Nothing has changed for me since the order was placed however I will be monitoring this a bit closer over the next week or so.
