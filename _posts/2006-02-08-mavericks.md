The big wave contest at Mavericks was held yesterday and a relatively unknown South African named Grant Baker walked away the winner along with the $30,000 purse.

SFGate.com has an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/mavericks/">article here</a> about the contest and there are additional photos <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/mavericks?o=0&f=/g/a/2006/02/05/mavericks.DTL&type=mavericks">here</a>.
