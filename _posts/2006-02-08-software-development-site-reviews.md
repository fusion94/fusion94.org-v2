<a href="http://www.devdawn.com/about-us/stu/">Stu</a> over at <a href="http://www.devdawn.com/">Dev Dawn</a> has a <a href="http://www.devdawn.com/top-10-googletechnorati-software-development-sites/">review</a> of Software Development websites.

It's a 2 part review and he has a decent writeup of <a href="http://sf.net">SourceForge</a> which as one of the Co-Founders is nice to see even 6 years (going on 7) after we launched it. Go give it a read and hopefully he'll post Part 2 soon.
