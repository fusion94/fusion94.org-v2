Ted Dziuba over at the <a href="http://epsilondelta.wordpress.com/">Epsilon-Delta</a> blog explains how MySQL Indexing works and the math behind it. His article "<a href="http://epsilondelta.wordpress.com/2006/02/08/dissecting-mysql-fulltext-indexing/">Dissecting MySQL Fulltext Indexing</a>" does a very good job explaining <em>"how"</em> MySQL indexing works and why it does certain things.

It's well worth the read if you're interested.
