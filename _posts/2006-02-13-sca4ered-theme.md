I switched the site over to the <a href="http://dancameron.org/wordpress/sca4ered-theme/">Sca4ered</a> theme designed by <a href="http://dancameron.org/">Dan Cameron</a> a few weeks ago. I really like the color scheme used which is why I chose to go with. Well in that vein I've created a couple of different header images that can be used with the theme.

<strong>Sca4ered Blue</strong>
<a href="/images/head-blue1.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Sca4ered Blue"><img src="/images/head-blue1.jpg" width="320" height="30" alt="Sca4ered Blue" /></a>

<strong>Sca4ered Green</strong>
<a href="/images/head-green1.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Sca4ered Green"><img src="/images/head-green1.jpg" width="320" height="30" alt="Sca4ered Green" /></a>

To use these images just unzip them into your wp-content/themes/Sca4ered.131/styles/sca4erd/ directory then modify wp-content/themes/Sca4ered.131/styles/sca4ered.css and replace background: #060B0F url('sca4erd/head.jpg') top left no-repeat; with either head-blue1.jpg or head-green1.jpg.

You can download the files <a href="/files/Sca4ered-headers.tar.gz">here</a>.
