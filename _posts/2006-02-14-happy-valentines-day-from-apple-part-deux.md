So <a href="http://apple.com">Apple Computer</a> also presented me with another present today in the form of an unexpected CPU ugrade for free. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> that we ordered for Nicole is now shipping with a 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo processor, up from the previously announced 1.67 GHz that we ordered with the machine.

This is pretty nice however when I logon to the Apple Store to check the order status I now see that the previous order:



<blockquote>Order number XXXXXXXXX
Estimated Shipped By: Feb 15, 2006
Estimated Delivered By: Feb 23, 2006</blockquote>



Now shows this:


<blockquote>Order number XXXXXXXXX
Estimated Shipped By: Feb 28, 2006
Estimated Delivered By: Mar 7, 2006</blockquote>



And that's not all folks. Magically a "second" MacBook Pro order is in the basket with this info:


<blockquote>Estimated Shipped By: Mar 15, 2006
Estimated Delivered By: Mar 22, 2006</blockquote>



Even more egregious is that it "appears" that we have now bought "2" MacBook Pro's as the billing portion which looked like this:



<blockquote>SubTotal:  	     $1,897.00
Tax: 	                  $160.56
Shipping Charge: 	$0.00
Total: 	                $2,057.56 </blockquote>



Now looks like this:

<blockquote>
SubTotal:  	     $3,794.00
Tax: 	                  $321.12
Shipping Charge: 	$0.00
Total: 	                $4,115.12 </blockquote>

I'm hoping that this is just a glitch in the system but I will be placing a call to Apple tomorrow.
