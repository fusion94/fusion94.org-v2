Here on valentine's day it's nice to see that Yahoo! presented us with a nice little gift in the form of open sourcing some of their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/index.html">UI Library</a> as well as opening up their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/index.php">Design Pattern Library</a>.

You can read more about it all over at the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/">Yahoo! User Interface Blog</a>.

I can't wait to try and incoporate some of this into the Sca4ered Theme.
