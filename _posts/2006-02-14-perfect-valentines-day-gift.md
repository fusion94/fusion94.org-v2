For Christmas I purchased Nicole a matching set of earrings and bracelet from <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/">Tiffany's</a>. Needless to say she was very suprised. So for Valentine's day I went ahead and purchased her the matching necklace to go with the other pieces. I do believe that she was stunned when the gift was presented to her.

Regardless this is about her gift to me. She picked me up the <em>"male equivalent Tiffany's little blue box"</em> for Valentine's day in the form of 3 pounds of bacon. It's actually Six 1/2 pound collections of different types of Bacon with 2 different types from Kinder's Custom Meats in the East Bay, 2 types from <a href="http://www.andronicos.com">Andronico's</a> here in San Francisco, and 2 more from Whole Foods. I'm telling you...this is the male equivalent of Tiffany's little blue box.

Anyways, on Saturday I'll be having a "Bacon Off" and comparing all 6 types as well as taking pictures and blogging about it.
