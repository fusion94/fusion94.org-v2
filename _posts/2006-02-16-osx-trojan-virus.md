So there's been information floating around all day in regards to Mac OSX's first "virus".  In reality while it can be considered a virus if you get infected by it you'd be pretty stupid. It's effectively a "non-virulent" virus that preys on the stupidity/lack of knowledge of the end user to behave in a certain manner.

The only way you can become infected is if you do ALL of the following:

1) Are somehow sent (via email, iChat, etc.) or download the <em><strong>"latestpics.tgz"</strong></em> file.
2) Double-click on the file to decompress it.
3) Double-click on the resulting file to "open" it.

And even of you do all of that if you aren't running as an admin user then you won't get infected. To be on the safe side if you receive this file via any method at all just delete it.
