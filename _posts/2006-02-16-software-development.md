One of my colleagues over at <a href="http://feedster.com">Feedster</a>, <a href="http://killersoft.com/randomstrings/">Clay Loveless</a>, has an <a href="http://www.killersoft.com/randomstrings/2006/02/16/walk-the-walk-before-talking-the-talk/">interesting blog post</a> regarding Professional Software Development and Professionalism in Software Development.

He hits on a few key points such as discipline and humility in his post and overall it's a very good read. If you haven't read it already you need to.
