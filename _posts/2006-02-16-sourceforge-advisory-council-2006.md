I'll be attending the SourceForce Advisory Council 2006 meeting March 7th-9th. Discussion topics will include extensions and integrations developed using the SOAP API, customization features added in SourceForge Enterprise Edition 4.3, and the new and highly customizable SourceForge Community Edition. We also be discussing proposed extensions and enhancements to SourceForge Enterprise Edition.

It's going to be good to see some of my old co-workers at <a href="http://vasoftware.com">VA</a> and especially nice to see where <a href="http://sf.net">SourceForge</a> is going.
