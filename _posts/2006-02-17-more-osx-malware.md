In a follow up to an earlier post <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/02/16/osx-trojanvirus/">located here</a> it appears now as though there's a "second" bit of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/alerts/info/malware.mspx">malware</a> floating around out there. F-Secure <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/inqtana_a.shtml">describes this as</a> "<em>a Java based proof of concept bluetooth worm that affects OSX 10.4 (Tiger) systems that have not been patched against vulnerability CAN-2005-1333"</em>.

<a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> has supposedly patched the issue so if you're running OSX 10.4.5 you should be safe.
