While persuing <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls Weblog</a> * today I noticed that he mentions a post that an old colleague of mine (<a href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti/">Don Marti</a>) at <a href="http://vasoftware.com">VA Research/VA Linux Systems/VA Software</a> authored in regards to how <a href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti/blosxom/software/blognet.html">"Alpha bloggers as we know them are an artifact of blog-reading tools"</a>.

It's worth reading if you have the time.

* Doc may not remember this but way back in 2000 at LWCE in San Jose he interviewed me for something or the other to do with <a href="http://sf.net">SourceForge</a>.
