If you've used the internet for longer than 10 minutes then you understand how rampant SPAM is. If you blog or have any other type of website out there then there's going to come a point where you'll want to publish your email address so that people can contact you. By doing so however you open yourself up to a whole range of crawlers and scrapers out there whose sole purpose is to get your email address specifically for Spammers.

Now you could just not publish your email address and not worry about this. You could also just use an imaging tool (such as photoshop or paint) to build an image that has your email address. Alternatively you can use this <a href="http://www.wbwip.com/wbw/emailencoder.html">tool</a> which encodes your email using character entities.

Your brower will display:
"For more information, send email to yourname@domain.com."

The sourcecode however looks like this:

"For more information, send email to &lt;A HREF="mailto:
&amp;#121;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#110;&amp;#097;&amp;#109;&amp;#101;<br />
&amp;#064;&amp;#100;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#046;<br />
&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;<span style="color: #0000FF;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&amp;#121;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#110;&amp;#097;&amp;#109;&amp;#101;<br />
&amp;#064;&amp;#100;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#046;<br />
&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;</span><br />&lt;/A&gt;"

This will not prevent all SPAM but will help you in the prevention of it.
