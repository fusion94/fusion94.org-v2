Last week I <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/02/14/perfect-valentines-day-gift/">wrote</a> about the perfect valentine's day gift in the form of 3 pounds of bacon that Nicole gave me. I also mentioned that I'd be doing a "Bacon-Off" and comparing and rating the 6 different types.

Unfortunately the "Bacon-Off" will be delayed until this next weekend or the next as we spent all this weekend repainting her sisters old room. If I never see another roller or brush then I'll be a happy man indeed.
