Apple's iTunes Music store had been updated with a new show from NBC. The show is entitled "<a href="http://www.nbc.com/Conviction/">Conviction</a>" and is brought to us from Emmy Award winner Dick Wolf ("Law & Order" franchise). NBC describes the show as <em>"A drama that focuses on the frenetic lives of young Manhattan assistant district attorneys and the challenging, emotional cases they confront. The complexities of the cases are matched by the personalities of those who prosecute them."</em>.

Regardless the Pilot episode is available for download for free along with a couple of extras.
