If you're using <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and are tired on the default look and feel of <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> then you should give <a href="http://gmailskins.mozdev.org/">Gmail Skins</a> a try.

Gmail Skins is nothing more than a Firefox extension that allows you to change the look and feel of your GMail Inbox. It also adds a few other elements.

So if you're tired of the standard gmail look and are feeling a bit adventurous then give it a try.
