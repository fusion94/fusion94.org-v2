<a href="http://www.snook.ca/jonathan/">Jonathan Snook</a> in an effort to understand <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype.js</a> better dissected Prototype 1.5.0_pre0. His efforts are documented in the form of some <a href="http://www.snook.ca/archives/000531.php">excellent cheatsheets</a>.

Well worth the read/download if you utilize the Prototype Library.
