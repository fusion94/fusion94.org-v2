How soon before we see Google Calendaring? Possibly sooner than expected.

If you go to <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?view=barc">http://mail.google.com/mail/?view=barc</a> you can see the Google Links preferences and can add a link to Google CL2. There's also a logon but neither of them appear to work.

Here are a few screenshots:

Hopefully Google will be releasing this soon as while <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> has been cool if I can get an integrated calendar with gmail I'll be a very happy camper indeed.
