My good friend <a href="http://lumma.de/">Nico Lumma</a> who used to work at <a href="http://vasoftware.com">VA Software</a> is now helping run a company in Cologne Germany that's just rolling out mobile version of Jabber called <a href="http://mabber.com">Mabber</a>.

I was lucky enough to see and use the product early on during it's development and I have to say that I like it. It's primarily based around the Jabber protocol but also has support for ICQ, Yahoo! Messenger, AIM and MSN Messenger.

I'm not going to do a proper review as of this time as <a href="http://www.nik.com.au/">Nik Cubrilovic</a> over at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> has a pretty good one <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/23/mabber-mobile-instant-messaging/">here</a>.

Registration is not open to the world at this time however I have quite a few tokens at my disposal so if you want to kick the tires then drop me a comment on this thread along with a way to contact you and I'll get you an invitation.
