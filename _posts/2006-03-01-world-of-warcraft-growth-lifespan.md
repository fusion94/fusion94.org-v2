In <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4713268.stm">this article</a> from the BBC some of the key people behind <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a> talk about the unprecedented growth of the game.

It's interesting as they never thought they'd have 5.5 million monthly subscribers after the first year and how they play on expanding and growing the game. The last quote (from the lead producer no less) is interesting to me as he says.

<blockquote>The world of Warcraft has so much more to give that I think we could be expanding it for five, 10, 20 years to come
Shane Dabiri
Blizzard
</blockquote>

So the real question is whether or not this image is a precursor of things to come.
