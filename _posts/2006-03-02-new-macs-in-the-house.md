NIcole and I have a few new Macs in the house. Her shiny new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> has arrived along with an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Intel Mac mini</a>.  Once I get them all setup I'll be blogging about the new bits.

The Mac mini is pretty much already setup and is attached to the television where <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/frontrow.html">Front Row</a> is streaming Movies, TV Shows and Music from the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">Power Mac G5</a>.
