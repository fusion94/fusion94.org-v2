Well according to the <a href="http://blog.newsvine.com/_news/2006/03/02/114888-newsvine-launches">Newsvine Blog</a> they have finally pulled the covers off the private beta and have gone live.

So what is it? Well it's a Meme Tracker/Conversation Tracker/News Tracker for starters. The layout is very user-friendly and fast. There are quite a few categories that the Tracker tracks and unlike <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> it's not just "Tech Related".

The other thing I've noticed is the lack of trolls that one expects to find on sites like <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> and Digg. I'm sure that now that Newsvine is live they will start to make an appearance but it's nice to not have to weed through that now.
