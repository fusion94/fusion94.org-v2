Adding to the already crowded MMOG market, Gamecloud has <a href="http://www.gamecloud.com/article.php?article_id=3268">reported</a> that game studio Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment will attempt to bring us Stargate Worlds, an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Role-Playing Game) based on the popular science-fiction television series, Stargate SG-1 & Stargate Atlantis.

As a huge fan of both series (I own all the DVDs that have been released to date) and as someone who started a game studio to build a MMORPG I'll be paying close attention to see if Cheyenne Mountain gets this right.

I love the fact that you'll be able to play as either a Stargate Command Member or as a System Lord. It would also appear that there's a focus on PvP as PvP will be possible between the two alliances on contested worlds, and the outcome of those battles will actually sway the balance of power on those planets which in turn can unlock hidden content.

It also appears that collaboration will be possible and that players will be <em>encouraged</em> to forge temporary alliances to deal with greater threats, such as the Ori. Since it appears that the Ori are present in the game I would assume that the Wraith are to make an appearance as well.
