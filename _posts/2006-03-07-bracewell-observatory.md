Stanford University has secured demolition permits from Santa Clara county and intend to pull down the Bracewell Observatory.

The Bracewell Observatory is named for Professor Ronald Bracewell, a father of radio astronomy, who created the site and built the dishes. They've been sitting idle since Federal Funding was redirected elsewhere.

Bob Lash has created <a href="http://www.bambi.net/stanford_dishes/rescue.html">Friends of the Bracewell Observatory Association</a> and hopes to save the dishes and proposes using them to:
<ul>
	<li>Open up the world of radio astronomy to Stanford students and the community</li>
	<li>Support the establishment of a teaching observatory for students in the Stanford Astronomy Program</li>
	<li>Provide mentoring</li>
	<li>Preserve and present the history, technical information, and scientific contributions made at this site</li>
	<li>Support teaching and research use by Stanford faculty</li>
	<li>Support access to the dishes for qualified projects, such as high school educational outreach and space communications research</li>
</ul>

He's already got support from NASA/JPL and needs more help.
