The iTunes Music Store (iTMS) has a free episode of Top Chef available for download <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=128315130&s=143441">here</a>.

From the <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Top_Chef/">Bravo</a> description:

<blockquote>
Bravo feeds the senses this March with "Top Chef," a new reality competition series celebrating the culinary arts with a fascinating window into the competitive, pressurized environment of world-class cookery and the restaurant business at the highest level. The ten-episode, one-hour series will feature twelve aspiring chefs who will put their culinary skills to the test for the chance to earn the prestigious title of "Top Chef."</blockquote>

I'm not sure if it's going to be any good but it is free content from the iTMS.
