Law & Order Criminal Intent is now available for purchase from the iTMS. Here's the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=130096706&s=143441">link</a> to the page.

With the addition of this now all 3 versions of Law & Order are available to purchase from the iTMS. Now all I need is for CBS, FX, and HBO to get with the program and start releasing content.
