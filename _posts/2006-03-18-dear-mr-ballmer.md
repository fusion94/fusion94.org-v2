<blockquote>After Sony announced on Tuesday that the Playstation 3 won't launch until November, the Xbox 360 is in a better position to become the top gaming console, says Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

"In every other generation, the first guy to 10 million consoles was the number one seller in the generation," Ballmer told FORTUNE in an interview on Thursday afternoon. "Did we just get an even better opportunity to be the first guy to 10 million? Yeah, of course we did."

There is still a production bottleneck because of problems with a component vendor, whom Ballmer declined to name, but he expects Microsoft to sell 5 million systems by June. "We're sort-of on track," he says, "though it would've been nice at Christmas to have one for everyone who wanted one."

Dear Mr. Ballmer,
Yes you got a wonderful opportunity to finally become the premier gaming console on the planet. If, and only if, you guys can pull your collective heads out of your asses and fix the damn production issues you've had that have dramatically impacted availability. (come on, 600,000 units sold worldwide in the 6 weeks it was released in 2005)

In short quit fiddle fucking around with shit like "Origami" and fix those issues. There are only 10 weeks until June and at your current rate there's no way you're going to sell 5 million systems by then. You might sell another million but that would be pushing it.

And for god's sakes....quit shipping units to Japan where they will just occupy space on shelves and sell them here in the USA.

Sincerely,
Just Another Gamer
