As mentioned in this <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/02/26/sprint-ambassador-program/">post</a> a few weeks ago I was asked to participate in the Sprint Ambassador Program and evaluate the Sprint Power Vision Service as well as a Sprint Power Vision Phone A920 (aka Samsung Model SPH-A920 Digital Dual Band Phone).

Well about a week ago I received a package from FedEx that contained the following items:
<ul>
	<li>One SPH-A920 Phone by Samsung with Sprint Power Vision Access</li>
	<li>Lithium Ion Battery</li>
	<li>AC Travel Charger</li>
	<li>32MB TransFLASH Memory Card and Adapter</li>
	<li>USB Cable</li>
	<li>Stereo Headset</li>
	<li>Activation Guide</li>
	<li>Phone User Guide</li>
	<li>Sprint Power Vision Guide</li>
</ul>

After unpacking everything and laying it out on my desk the first thing that caught my eye was the warning label affixed to the Stereo Headset packaging. It stated:

<blockquote>Use of this headset with both ears covered while driving may not be permitted by law in certain states.</blockquote>

I'm not sure why that struck me as funny but it did. Well actually I know why. If you're stupid enough to be driving a motor vehicle while wearing headphones then you are a prime candidate for a <a href="http://www.darwinawards.com/">Darwin Award</a>.

Regardless, so I unpacked the phone and charged it fully, once charged I decided that it was time to start playing with it. Here are my thoughts on the phone itself and NOT the service.

First up we have the Technical Specs:

I'm not a huge fan of "flip phones" but this one I'm liking. It's not too bulky and fits nicely into my pockets. The screen is crisp and clear and I was able to customize the phone to my liking without too much trouble (hello "IT Crowd ringtone"). The only real issue I've had so far after a week of using it is that adding contacts can be a pain in the butt until you get used to the way they do it.

I'll be blogging more this week in regards to the service.
