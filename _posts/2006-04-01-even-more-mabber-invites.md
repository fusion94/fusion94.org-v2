I had previously mentioned having Mabber invites in these posts <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/02/26/mabber/">Mabber</a> and <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/03/11/more-mabber-invites/">More Mabber Invites</a> and have given out about 70 invites.

Well the good news is that I still have quite a few invites to pass out. (let's just say the number is greater than 100 but less than 10,000) If you want an invite there are a FEW SIMPLE RULES so listen up.

1) Use a "valid, real email address" when posting a comment. Invites are sent out via email.
2) Only post ONCE. Yes it may take a day or two for me to get the invite out to you but I only want to deal with one comment/invite request per poster.
3) Only ask for an invite on this post.

And that's it. Simple enough eh?
