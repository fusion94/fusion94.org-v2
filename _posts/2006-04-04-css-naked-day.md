<a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">Dustin Diaz</a>: Welcome to the first annual CSS naked day which will be happening April5th, 2006. The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of (x)html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and; well, a fun play on words. I mean, who doesnâ€™t want to get naked?
