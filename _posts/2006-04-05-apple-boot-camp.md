Apple today introduced Boot Camp, public beta software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to run Windows XP. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Available as a download</a> today, Boot Camp allows users with a Microsoft Windows XP installation disc to install Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac, and once installation is complete, users can restart their computer to run either Mac OS  X or Windows XP. Boot Camp will be a feature in “Leopard,” Apple’s next major release of Mac OS X.

This is very cool. I can't wait to get home and try and install Windows XP Media Center on my Intel Mac Mini.
