Some of you may know while others may not, but I'm happy to announce that I've officially joined <a href="http://omnidrive.com">Omnidrive</a> as their CTO.

Omnidrive is a hosted storage platform that is currently in private alpha testing to a limited subset of users. Omnidrive promises to change the way you access and share your files from whichever device you are on.

In joining Omnidrive I'll be:
<ul>
<li>Helping define, develop and deploy Omnidriveâ€™s technology architecture, ensuring that it maximizes revenue, minimizes costs, and provides a firm, flexible foundation for the future. </li>
<li>Ensuring that all technology deployments are properly implemented, integrated and supported.</li>
<li>Developing ground rules, performance criteria and enforcement mechanisms for service-level agreements with relevant Infrastructure service providers.</li>
</ul>

I'm happy to join the team at Omnidrive and I look forward to rolling out our product to a larger set of users in the very near future.
