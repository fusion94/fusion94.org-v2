<a href="http://lumma.de/">Nico</a> and the guys over at <a href="http://mabber.com">Mabber</a> have pulled the covers off the invitations and are now allowing anyone to <a href="http://invite.mabber.com/register.php?mabber_reg_lang=en">register</a> for a Mabber account.

I've closed down the comments on the posts that I wrote where I was giving away Invites. I was able to give out approximately 100+ invites in the short time that I ran the posts.

Good luck to Nico and his team with Mabber.
