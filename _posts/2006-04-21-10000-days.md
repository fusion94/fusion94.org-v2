Wow. Tool will break a five-year silence on May 2 with its next Volcano album entititled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EULJLU/sr=8-4/qid=1145648444/ref=pd_bbs_4/002-2156482-0840829?%5Fencoding=UTF8">10,000 Days</a>".  It's a follow-up to 2001's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005B36H/sr=8-1/qid=1145648444/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-2156482-0840829?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Lateralus</a>" and is a long time coming.

Here's the tracklisting:
