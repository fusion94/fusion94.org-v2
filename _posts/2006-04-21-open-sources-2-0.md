My good friend (and ex-coworker) <a href="http://dibona.com">Chris DiBona</a> was the author of Open Sources 2.0.

That book is now available as a free <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/opensources2.000diborich">download</a> as a PDF. If you like it you can still purchase the hard copy at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596008023/sr=8-1/qid=1145647867/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-2156482-0840829?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Amazon</a>.
