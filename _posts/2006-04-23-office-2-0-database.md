<a href="http://ghalimi.us/blog/">Ismael Chang Ghalimi</a> over at <a href="http://itredux.com/">IT|Redux</a> has compiled a fairly comprehensive database of <a href="http://itredux.com/office-20/database/">Office 2.0 Applications</a>.

He's broken them down by type of application and provides links to the applications as well as reviews of the application from IT|Redux, <a href="http://solutionwatch.com">Solution Watch</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a>. He also provides a ton of other data related to the application and it's well worth visiting just to check out some of the applications.
