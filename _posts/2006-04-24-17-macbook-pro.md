<a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> has the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">17&#x22; MacBook Pro</a> up for order in the Apple Store. Near as I can tell the only difference between the one I have and this is the screen size and resolution as well as weight.

I've now had 2 17&#x22; Powerbooks in the past as well as as 3 15&#x22; models and I have to say that I love the screen real estate of the 17&#x22; ones but they are completely useless while traveling on a plane.

I'm thrilled with the 15&#x22; MacBook Pro that I have and since I'll be traveling overseas a fair amount I think it was the right decision to go with.
