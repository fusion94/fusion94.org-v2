According to <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-scifi-galacticaprequel,0,6083698.story?coll=zap-news-headlines">Zap2It</a> there's a Battlestar Galactica Prequel called <em>Caprica</em> in the works.

<em>Caprica</em> takes place approximately 50 years before BSG does and focuses on 2 families. The Adamas and the Graystones. The 12 colonies are at peace and a technological revolution is about to occur with the creation of the first cylon.

No word yet as to when this will be released and my buddy that works on <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">BSG</a> hasn't gotten back to me.

SciFI now has some <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=35773">news</a> regarding this.
