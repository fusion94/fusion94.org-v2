<a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> has released a new ad campaign called <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/">'Get A Mac'</a>. It lists 14 reasons as to why you'll love a mac and also has a series of <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">ads for Television</a> that are fairly humorous in their own right.

If you haven't seen them on the tube yet you should go check them out.
