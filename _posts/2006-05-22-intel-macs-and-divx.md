One of the biggest issues I've had so far with the MacBook Pro is that I've not been able to watch some of my TV shows that have been ripped using the XviD Codec. I had installed the DiVX software but all I was able to get was a white screen in Quicktime Pro.

This issue has now been resolved with the <a href="http://community.divx.com/labs/viewEntry.php?id=157&cid=3">Universal Binary Release</a> of the DiVX software.  Download it if you've been experiencing the same issues and it should solve your problem.
