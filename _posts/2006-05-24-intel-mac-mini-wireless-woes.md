If you have one of the Intel Mac mini's and you're having a few issues with wireless connectivity (i.e. connection dropping, slower than usual speeds, etc) as I was having, then the solution is to re-configure your wireless router to drop down to 802.11B instead of 802.11G or mixed (B & G).

After doing this my Intel Mac mini's wireless performance increased considerably. I'm not sure as to why this happens but I'm at least happy with the performance now.
