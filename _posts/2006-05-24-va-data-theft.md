By now most people are aware that a laptop with an external hard drive was stolen from a residence in an apparent random burglary from the Montgomery County, Maryland, home of a Department of Veterans Affairs computer analyst.

The computer disk contained the names, Social Security numbers and birth dates of every living veteran from 1975 to the present, (Approximately 26.5 million veterans) the missing data does not include health records or financial information, the department said. Also included on the disk was some disability ratings and data on some veterans' spouses.

If you're a veteran and you have questions you can contact the agency at (800) 333-4636 or through the <a href="www.firstgov.gov">federal government's web site</a>.
