The SciFi channel and NBC Universal have announced a 10 episode series available on the web only called Battlestar Galactica: Resistance.

IGN has the story <a href="http://tv.ign.com/articles/709/709633p1.html">here</a>.

<blockquote>The most exciting news on this front involved Battlestar Galactica, which airs on the NBC Universal owned Sci Fi Channel. Debuting later this year will be a Web series spin-off for the acclaimed series called Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance. Lasting ten episodes, The Resistance will fill in the gap between season two and the upcoming season three.</blockquote>

Unfortunately I've not seen any information as to when this is going to start airing.
