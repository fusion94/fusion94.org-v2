Nicole has been disussing getting a new vehicle for some time now so a few weeks ago we went out and looked at several and test drove them as well.

The vehicles looked at included the Acura MDX, the Nissan Murano, the Lexus RX 350, the Lexus RX 400 Hybrid, the Infiniti FX35 and the Land Rover LR3. Now each vehicle was similiar in size and features but each had little issues with them that knocked them out of the running.

In the end she decided to go with the Land Rover LR3. Here are a few pictures.
