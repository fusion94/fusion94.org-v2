To go along with my post on <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/06/03/essential-os-x-software/">Essential OS X Software</a>, here's my list of "Essential Firefox Extensions".

<a href="http://firefox.exxile.net/">All-In-One Sidebar</a>
All-in-One Sidebar is a sidebar control, inspired by Opera's. It lets you quickly switch between sidebars, view dialog windows such as downloads, extensions, and more in the sidebar, or view source or websites in the sidebar. It includes a slide-out button and a toolbar, all of which can be extensively customized.

All-In-One Sidebar provides enhancements for many built-in features

With ColorZilla you can get a color reading from any point in your browser, quickly adjust this color and paste it into another program. You can Zoom the page you are viewing and measure distances between any two points on the page. The built-in palette browser allows choosing colors from pre-defined color sets and saving the most used colors in custom palettes.

Greasemonkey is a Firefox extension which lets you to add bits of DHTML ("user scripts") to any web page to change its behavior. In much the same way that user CSS lets you take control of a web page's style, user scripts let you easily control any aspect of a web page's design or interaction.
