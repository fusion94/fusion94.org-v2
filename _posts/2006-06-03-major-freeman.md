In stark contrast to the Jesse Macbeth debacle I present you Army Maj. Chase A. Freeman, of Ponca City, Nebraska, who was awarded a Bronze Star medal of valor for his role in a firefight in Afghanistan on Oct. 10, 2005.

<blockquote>
Major Chase A. Freeman, United States Army, distinguished himself by exceptional valor under fire during combat operations from 10 to 11 October 2005 in vicinity of Bagh-Khosak Village, Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan.

While on patrol Maj. Freeman and his team were attacked by approximately 150 enemy soldiers from 3 separate ambush positions.

Maj. Freeman assessed the situation and realized that because of all the heavy fighting, his ANA soldiers were going to need a re-supply of ammunition. He knew that the only re-supply of ammunition was located in an abandoned truck left at the initial attack position.

There is little doubt that Major Freemanâ€™s leadership and personal courage allowed his unit to maneuver on and destroy over 45 enemy personnel during a 13-hour period.</blockquote>
