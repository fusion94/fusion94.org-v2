Best-of-seven series (all games on ABC and ABCHD and all times are EST)

<img src="http://fusion94.org/images/abchd_logo.jpg" alt="ABC HD" />

Thursday, June 8: Miami at Dallas, 8 p.m.
Sunday, June 11: Miami at Dallas, 8 p.m.
Tuesday, June 13: Dallas at Miami, 8 p.m.
Thursday, June 15: Dallas at Miami, 8 p.m.
Sunday, June 18: Dallas at Miami, if necessary, 8 p.m.
Tuesday, June 20: Miami at Dallas, if necessary, 8 p.m.
Thursday, June 22: Miami at Dallas, if necessary, 8 p.m.

I can't wait for this series if nothing more than getting to watch all the games in HD. Comcast in it's infinite wisdom doesn't provide TNT HD for Bay Area subscribers so the Dal-Pho series looked like crap compared to the Mia-Det series (which was shown on ESPN HD). Comcast instead provides Bay Area subscribers with 2 preview HD channels. Morons.
