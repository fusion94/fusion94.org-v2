Nicole and I participated in a 4 man - best ball scramble last Friday at the PGC. Even though it was only her 4th time to play on a real course and first time having to deal with Par 4's and Par 5's we ended up shooting +2 over par and ended up taking second place in the tournament.

I thought she did really well and hopefully next time we can take first place.
