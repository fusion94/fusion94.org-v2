The Sci-Fi channel has decided to not renew Stargate SG-1 past it's current 10th season. Stargate SG-1 is currently the longest-running science-fiction series on U.S. television to date.

It has however decided to pick up a fourth season of its more-popular spinoff, "Stargate Atlantis."

As a Stargate Fan I'm disappointed that there's not going to be an 11th season but ever since Richard Dean Anderson left the show (at the end of the 8th season) the show has been steadily declining. This isn't anyone's fault as I believe his replacement, Ben Browder (of Farscape fame) has done a great job of replacing him but it's still not the same.
