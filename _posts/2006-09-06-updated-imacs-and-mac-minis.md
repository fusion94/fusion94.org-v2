I'm not sure if this happened yesterday or this morning but Apple has just updated the entire iMac line to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors in each model. They've also introduced a new 24" model as well. The iMac line up now includes 4 models: 1.83 GHz and a 2.0 GHz 17", a 2.16 GHz 20" and the new 2.16 GHz 24" iMac.

The new 17" iMacs have a price of $999, which is a great price. Oddly enough though, is that the Apple Remote doesn't come with it standard. So if you get yourself a 17" you're going to have to spend an additional $29 for the Apple Remote. Which truthfully you will need if you ever plan on using FrontRow.

Also to note is that the Mac Mini has gotten processor upgrades. The $799 Mac Mini now comes with a 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo processor instead of a 1.66 GHz Intel Core Duo processor, and the $599 Mac Mini comes with a 1.66 GHz Intel Core Duo processor instead of a 1.5 GHz Intel Core Solo processor Mac mini.
