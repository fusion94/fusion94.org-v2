Have a hard time remembering the details of unix permissions octal notation for use with chmod? Well all you need to do is go this <a href="http://per.ms/">cheatsheet</a>, select a few radio checkboxes and you'll get the octal notation you're looking for.

My buddy <a href="http://killersoft.com/randomstrings/">Clay</a> whipped this up by using the <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>/<a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a> support in <a href="http://solarphp.com/">Solar</a> while on a commuter train.

If you think it's cool then please give it a <a href="http://digg.com/software/Octal_Notation_Cheatsheet">digg</a>
