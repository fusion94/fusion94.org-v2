Thursday I had the opportunity to play in the <a href="http://www.secondchancerescue.com/special_join.html">"Mulligan's for Mutts" golf tournament</a>. We (the format was a four-man scramble) played over at <a href="http://www.stonetreegolf.com/">StoneTree Golf Club</a> over in Marin county and ended up in 7th place with a score of 70 (-2).

StoneTree is a difficult course and we were happy with our end result. Even better was the fact that approximately $15,000 was raised for the <a href="http://www.secondchancerescue.com">Second Chance Rescue Organization</a>. If you are feeling charitable and have a few extra $$ head over there and make a contribution. They accept checks, cash and PayPal.
