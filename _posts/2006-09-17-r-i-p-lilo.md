<blockquote>On the 12th September Rob Levin, known to many as Freenode's lilo, was hit by a car while riding his bike. He suffered head injuries and was in a coma. Rob was being treated at the Neuro Trauma Intensive Care Unit at a local hospital in Houston, Texas where he passed away on Sept 16th</blockquote>

I've known lilo for approximately 8 years now from back when I was working at <a href="http://vasoftware.com">VA Linux</a> and he was over at <a href="http://linuxcare.com">Linuxcare</a>. He could be a pain in the ass at times but then again who couldn't be. Regardless I wish his family well.
