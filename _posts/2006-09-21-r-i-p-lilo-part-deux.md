I posted <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/09/17/rip-lilo/">earlier</a> on the death of Rob Levin aka Lilo. Well now there's some questions going about as to the validity of his death.

You can read more about it <a href="http://www.chatmag.com/news/191806_levin_death_unconfirmed.html">here</a> but it seems that his death cannot be confirmed with any authorities located within the county of where he supposedly died.
