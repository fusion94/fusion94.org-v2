As of tomorrow my 6 month Sprint Ambassador Program service will be terminated. I've already secured a new plan and phone through Verizon Wireless and if you happened to have had my old Sprint # (816-352-XXXX) and you need to reach me drop me an email and I'll provide you the new phone number to reach me at.

Overall I thought the Sprint Ambassador Program was a good deal although the Power Vision service quit working about halfway through the program and I never did give Sprint a call to determine what the deal was. I was glad to participate in the program and my post on <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2006/04/22/howto-sync-a-samsung-a920-with-mac-osx/">HOWTO sync the Samsung A920</a> with OSX garnered approximately 14,000 page views.
