I've been playing around a bit with Dashcode* the past day or so just to get myself familiar with it and tonight whipped up a countdown timer for the start of Battlestar Galactica's Season 3.

It's not much and it's kind of cheesy but if you care you can download it <a href="/files/BSG_Timer.wdgt.zip">here</a>.

* Dashcode is a WYSIWYG for Dashboard Widgets that should be a part of the XCode 3.0 tools that will be released with OS X 10.5 (Leopard). Dashcode offers a built-in debugger and all the text editing features of a professional Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The editor also integrates with the debugger, so you can easily set and view breakpoints, and track your widgetâ€™s execution through the source code.
