On friday Nicole and I celebrated our anniversary. Due to this I didn't get to see the Season 3 premiere of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a> but I did drop it onto the DVR for future viewing. We had a good time and ended up going to see "<a href="http://thedeparted.warnerbros.com/">The Departed</a>" followed by dinner at a Peruvian place.

We both thought that "The Departed" was far and away the best movie we've seen this year and if you're thinking of seeing it then you should. The acting by all the actors was superb and this is one of those movies that you have to see on the the big screen to get the full effect of the film.
