I had been using <a href="http://www.chatelp.org/">Sidenote</a> for some time now on both my G5 and the MacBook Pro. I was primarily using it a temporary storage device for URLs and quick notes to myself. One of the issues I've had with it is that there was no way to keep the two copies in sync.

Well I've decided to replace Sidenote with <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/index.html">Google Notebook</a>.  Google Notebook is a Firefox Extension that allows you to browse, clip, and organize information from across the web in a single online location that's accessible from any computer. It also allows you to share your notebook with others should you chose to do so. It works with Firefox 1.5 as well as the Firefox 2.0 Release Candidates.
