LORI (life-of-request info) is a Firefox extension that adds the following functionality to Firefox.

For a given page,

* track how long it takes to see the first byte from remote server (time-to-first-byte (TTFB))
* track how long it takes to complete displaying the page (time-to-completion (TTC)
* track the page size
* track number of sub-requests used to build the page

Unfortunately it hasn't been updated in several months. I've taken the liberty to make it compatible with Firefox 2.

You can download it <a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/lori_life-of-request_info_-0.1.1.20061025-fx.xpi">here</a>. Make sure you right-click and save as.
