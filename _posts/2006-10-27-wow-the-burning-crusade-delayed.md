<a href="http://www.blizzard.com/">Blizzard Entertainment</a> announced this past week that their expansion pack to <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/">WoW</a> entitled The Burning Crusade <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154629">would be delayed</a> until at least January.

 I was really looking forward to this in a month or so but at least the delay will allow me to level up my warrior to 60 before the expansion pack is released.
