If like me, you're running Microsoft Vista on a Macbook Pro (there's a windows software development involved in my new gig) then you really should download and install <a href="http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=34515">Input Remapper</a>. You'll have to first uninstall the Apple Keyboard Drivers but once you do and install the tool you can easily remap your keys and regain right-click functionality with the default Macbook Pro Keyboard.
