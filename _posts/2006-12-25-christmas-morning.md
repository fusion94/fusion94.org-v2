So for Christmas I got a round of Golf at Pasatiempo (been wanting to play there for awhile now) as well as Quake 4. Which by the way plays awesome on the new shiny Mac Pro.

Oh yeah....I also asked Nicole to marry me and she actually said yes. So I'm engaged. Date for a wedding to be determined but I'm shooting for 2010.  :)

Merry Christmas.
