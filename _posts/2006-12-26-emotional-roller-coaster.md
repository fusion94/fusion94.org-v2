So yesterday was an emotional roller coaster. I got engaged yesterday morning and also found out later that afternoon that a good friend of mine from the VA Linux Systems days also got engaged. Then I hear that another ex-VA'er lost his grandmother and another ex-VA Engineer lost his battle with cancer.

I'm not really sure what else I can say.
