Every year at the Presidio Golf Club there's a match play tournament called the DiMaggio Cup named after Joltin' Joe DiMaggio who was a member of the Presidio Golf Club for a number of years up until his death on March 8, 1999.

I didn't get to play in the DiMaggio Cup last year but this year after a number of difficult matches I was able to win my flight and receive the champions trophy.
