There has been quite a bit of discussion in regards to whether or not Silverlight is a Flash killer etc.

I believe PiperJaffray Analysts said it best with this:

<strong>Microsoft's Silverlight: Loud Bark, Soft Bite?</strong>
<strong>KEY POINTS:</strong>
• Microsoft recently unveiled Silverlight, a supposed Flash rival.
• We expect Silverlight's impact on Adobe's business to be immaterial.
• Flash is the web's fastest growing video distribution platform on the web,
and the developer community is committed to Flash as a standard for RIAs.
• Adobe is pushing ahead in online video with Apollo and Adobe Media Player.

<strong>What Is Silverlight? </strong>Microsoft recently demonstrated its new Silverlight
technology, a web development tool for rich Internet applications (RIAs) and a
supposed rival to Adobe's Flash and Flex. The Silverlight runtime is available as a
cross-platform beta plug-in available for web browsers including Internet Explorer,
Firefox, and Safari; Microsoft expects to have a final release by mid-2007.

<strong>Silverlight's Impact Will Be Immaterial.</strong> We believe Silverlight's impact on Flash
and Flex will be minimal for three reasons: 1) Flash video technology is the fastest
growing video distribution platform on the Internet; Adobe has a growing lead in
the RIA space. YouTube, for example, which uses Flash technology, garnered an
audience of ~45m unique users in March (up from ~13m a year ago); 2) Microsoft
plays catch-up with Adobe, Adobe continues to innovate. On 4/15 we attended the
NAB tradeshow where Adobe focused on its plans for online Video. Specifically,
the company introduced Adobe Media Player, the next leg in Adobe's video
strategy, which builds on the success of Flash and implements the new Apollo
technology; and 3) Web developers are loyal to Adobe (and ex-Macromedia)
products, and now that CS3 integrates Adobe's design products with the
Macromedia tools, we expect the Flash developer base will become even more
deeply entrenched in Flash and Flex as standards for RIAs. In early 2006, Adobe
had announced that there were more than 2 million Flash developers.
