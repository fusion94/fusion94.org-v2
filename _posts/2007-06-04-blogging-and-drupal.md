Originally I was going to use this domain name to tell the story of Damage Studios, a San Francisco based game development studio that I founded in mid-2002. 

Now that I'm doing more and more work with the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal CMS</a> I'm going to use this site as a journal to reflect that work. 

Here are the first bits:
<ul>
<li>I hope to release a few Installation Profiles as well as a starter module in the next week or so.
<li>I'm also working on completing a performance test report on Drupal using memcache and opcode optimizers.
</ul>
