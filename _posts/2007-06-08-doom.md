No not that Doom.....the Doom I'm referring to is <a href="http://www.the-legion-of-doom.com/">"The Legion of Doom"</a>.

TLOD is the music production/remix team of Chad Blinman and Trever Keith. Their first major Project was <i>Incorporated</i> which is absolutely fu***** brilliant. <i>Incorporated</i> was a series of mashups of songs by bands popular in the punk/emo/hardcore genres. If you go to their site and register as a user you can visit the forums where you can download the complete album.

I heartily recommend doing so.
