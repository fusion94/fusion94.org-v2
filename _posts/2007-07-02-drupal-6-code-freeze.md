Formal announcement tomorrow on the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> website but it looks as though Drupal 6 is frozen as of today.


It looks as though it's time to fix bugs and QA the hell out of it.

If you haven't started testing your modules against the 6.x code base then go grab a copy of the development snapshot of <a href="http://drupal.org/node/97368">Drupal 6</a> and help us test.
