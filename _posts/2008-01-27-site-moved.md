I've moved all the content off of http://fusion94.org/blog and have imported here into the Damage Studios site. It was getting tiring trying to determine where to blog and since the old site was running WordPress and I'm now doing more Drupal related work it made sense to move it into Drupal. Thanks to PathAuto and aliasing about 98% of the old urls redirect properly.

I know that there are some things not quite right but I hope to resolve these issues in the next week or so.
