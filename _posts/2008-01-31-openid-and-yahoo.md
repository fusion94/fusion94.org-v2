As of yesterday all of Yahoo's esitmated 248 million users worldwide now have the means to login to any site that supports OpenID. Currently they are only an OpenID provider and not a consumer which means that you cannot login to Yahoo services using your OpenID but I'd imagine that will change sometime in the near future.

If you haven't enabled your Yahoo account for OpenID access then head over to <a href="http://openid.yahoo.com">http://openid.yahoo.com</a> and do so.
