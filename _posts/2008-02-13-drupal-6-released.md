I know that I hadn't blogged about the Drupal 6 RC4 version due to work related issues but who cares. 

<a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/drupal-6.0.tar.gz">Drupal 6</a> is now an offical release. What did it take? Over a year of development and over 1600 issues resolved. You can read more about the release <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0">here</a>.

I've got a version of this site running an earlier release candidate so migrating over will be coming soon. The biggest issue will be getting the theme ported over.
