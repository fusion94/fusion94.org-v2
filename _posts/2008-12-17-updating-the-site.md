This site has been running on a Drupal 5 codebase for quite some time. This morning I took the time to upgrade to Drupal 6.8 then upgraded to the lastest version of the Acquia Network Community Server.

So far it's gone well and has been relatively drama free. There are some older Drupal 5 modules that I need to update to get full functionality back so if you see any issues please use the contact form to drop me a note and let me know.

thanks
