If you've got BootCamp installed and have it defaulting to boot into Windows then remove the Windows partion you're going to get a "No bootable disk found" screen everytime you boot up. 

I still don't know why OSX isn't smart enough to handle this issue with more grace but that's another post altogether.

To resolve this just follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer and hold down the Option key until disk icons appear onscreen.
<li>Select the startup disk with the operating system you want to use (safe bet that it's going to be OSX), and then click the arrow beneath the icon.
<li>Once OSX is launched, go to System Preferences, and select the OSX volume as the startup disk. 
</ol>

Once you've completed these steps you'll be able to reboot back into OSX without the annoying screen.
