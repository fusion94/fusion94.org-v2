My fantasy football season ended last night. 

In the Skyfire League I ended up with the best overall record of 11-3 with 1,486 points scored and went into the playoffs as the #1 seed. I ended up losing my first playoff game but was able to rally and capture the third place trophy.

In the Public League I ended up with a record of 7-6-1 with 1,293 points scored and went into the playoffs as the #4 seed. Due to quite a bit of luck I won out all my playoff games and captured the first place trophy.
