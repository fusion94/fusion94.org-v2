So I finally got around to releasing a package of the Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Dedicated Servers. 

They can be downloaded <a href="/files/MoHAA_Dedicated_Servers_1.2.zip">here</a>.

I plan on releasing new versions of the Game Server Configurator: MoHAA in the next few weeks and you will need these to use that tool.

<b>NOTE:</b>
These are command line server binaries that allow you to host a MoHAA server without running the MoHAA client.

<b>DISCLAIMER:</b>
These binaries are released as a non-supported product. That means that neither Aspyr Media, Inc. nor Damage Studios technical support center can answer or help with any issues you may encounter with this release.
