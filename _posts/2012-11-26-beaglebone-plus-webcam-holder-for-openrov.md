As I've been working with the [BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org/bone) linux computer as part
of the OpenROV project I was getting frustrated with the lack of stands/mounting brackets out
there to secure the BeagleBone.

I searched [Thingiverse](http://thingiverse.com/) and located the [BeagleBone + Webcam holder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30537).
I tried to print this on my Prusa and while it came out more or less all right the angled overhang
was really sloppy. This version also uses printed stand up pins to secure the BeagleBone and a
latching system that wasn't completely compatible with the use of a [BeagleBone Cape](http://beagleboard.org/cape).

__Version One (V1)__

So I redesigned the original part in SketchUp and made it boxier without the overhang. This
produced a totally usable product although it took 2.5 hours to print and still suffered from
the issue of not properly securing the BeagleBone.

Here is a photo of Version One:

__Version Two (V2)__

In talking with this further with [Todd Sampson](http://toddsampson.com/) we decided to reduce
the mass of the model as well as removed the stand up pins used to secure the BeagleBone and
replaced them with 3mm holes so that the BeagleBone could be properly secured to the holder.
Version Two also takes less than 40 minutes to print.

Here is a photo of Version Two:

In the end either stand is perfect for working with the OpenROV BeagleBone and OpenROV Cape. It is suitable for sitting on your desk, or for mounting to a wall. You can download everything related to it at:
