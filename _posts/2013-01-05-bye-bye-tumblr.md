This is my first post published using [Octopress](http://octopress.org) after several years of using either [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and/or [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) and I’d like to share the reasons why I chose to move from a blogging platform and switch to a statically generated site.

Yes, because what you are reading is pure static old-school HTML, generated by Octopress on my MacBook Pro. Also to note is that everything here is being served by GitHub through the Pages feature, completely free.

* Octopress sports a clean responsive theme written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.
* Code blogging is easy and beautiful. Embed code (with Solarized styling) in your posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.
* Third party integration is simple with built-in support for Twitter, Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and Google Analytics.
* It's easy to use. A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
* Ships with great plug-ins some original and others from the Jekyll community — tested and improved.

### Ease of Use
[Octopress](http://octopress.org) is a framework built upon [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the Ruby static site generator that powers GitHub Pages.

Jekyll takes a content directory, parses all the articles and pages through a Markdown converter and generates a static website that can be served with almost anything.

Octopress leverages all the power of Jekyll adding a great HTML5 template, mobile ready, and a lot of features like archives, an xml sitemap, code highlighting, external services integration (Twitter, Github, Google+, Facebook), and much much more.

This solution makes your website really fast because there’s no dynamic code that runs on the server and no databases.

### 3rd Party Plugins
Octopress has a wealth of [3rd Party Plugins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins) that will allow you to do most anything you want to do.

### Themes
Octopress also has quite a few [3rd Party Themes](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes) for you to use and to customize.

### Open Source
Best of all is that Octopress is Open Source and licensed under The MIT License.
