We're glad to hear that many of the kits made it under the Christmas tree! Now, the next phase: building them!

The [OpenROV Wiki](http://wiki.openrov.com) is really starting to fill out: [Step by Step Instructions](http://wiki.openrov.com/index.php/Assembly#Step_by_step_instructions)

That's the best place to start. The goal is for each section of the build to have:
1. Tools/Materials/Parts
2. Video/Photos/Explanation
3. Test (to make sure it works and you don't move on until it's functioning correctly)
4. Troubleshooting

The endcap process is a good example of what we are striving for: [Endcap Assembly](http://wiki.openrov.com/index.php/Assembling_and_Gluing_the_end_caps)

The most important thing to remember: the OpenROV is a work-in-progress. If you have a question, or a doubt, or an idea: SPEAK UP! The only way this project gets better is if it continues to be tweaked and improved by everyone who works on it. If you think you've got a better way of explaining something - let's discuss it!

Also, we're planning on hosting build days at our small office in Berkeley. We'll be streaming the build days from our new [OpenROV Community page on G+](https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/116561282178440599596) so anyone around the world can tune in and ask questions (all videos will be archived on Youtube).

The first build day - the acrylic structure - will be on Saturday, January 19th starting at 12pm PST.

If you want to join us in-person in Berkeley, please send David Lang an email at: david @ openrov.com

__What is OpenROV__

OpenROV is a  Do It Yourself telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration and education. We have developed a low-cost telerobotic submarine that can be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts. The goal of OpenROV is to democratize exploration by allowing anyone to explore and study underwater environments.

Here's a short video of it in action.
