Last night I Open Sourced an iOS application called [Legendary](https://github.com/fusion94/Legendary). Legendary displays catchphrases and memorable quotes from the character Barney Stinson from the hit show _How I Met Your Mother_.

This application was originally developed using the [Appcelerator Titanium](http://appcelerator.com) framework and will build for iOS only at the moment but I'd love to see it ported over to Android and other mobile platforms.

As an aside this is __only__ the mobile client side of the application. There's a server side component as well that will also be open sourced later this week.

Below is all the data from the README.md on [GitHub](http://github.com)

### Description
Legendary displays catchphrases and memorable quotes from the character Barney Stinson.

Browse and discover the only collection of Barney Stinson quotes available on the iPhone!

Who is Barney Stinson?

* He is a womanizer, favors suits, laser tag, and uses the words "awesome" and "legendary" frequently.
* Barney is almost always seen wearing a suit and makes great use of his catchphrase, "Suit up!", often modifying it for a particular situation (i.e., "Snowsuit up!" while making an igloo in Central Park, or "Flight suit up!" when he dresses as a "kick a** fighter pilot" for Halloween, or "Slut Up!" when Lily and Robin get ready to go to a high school prom, or when he says "Space suit up Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon," in the episode where Ted may or may not have a threesome).
