So for whatever reason Google has chosen to hide the developer settings in the latest version of Jelly Bean. Here's how to get them back.

There's a pretty easy way to re-enable developer setttings and here's how to do it.

1. Go to the settings menu, and scroll down to `"About phone."` Tap it.
2. Scroll down to the bottom again, where you see `"Build number."` (Your build number may vary from ours here.)
3. Tap it seven (7) times. After the third tap, you'll see a dialog that says you're four taps away from being a developer. Keep on tapping, and eventually, you've got the developer settings back.
