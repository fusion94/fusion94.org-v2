For the past few days I've been kicking the tires on the [Atom Editor](http://atom.io) from [GitHub](https://github.com).

After using it full time for the better part of this time I can say that I believe that this will become my full time editor of choice completely replacing Sublime Text 3.

As such I've started to port over a couple of themes that I used in both Textmate and Sublime Text.

You can locate all the details about them here:

* [Made of Code Theme](https://atom.io/packages/made-of-code)
* [Idlefingers Theme](https://atom.io/packages/idlefingers)
