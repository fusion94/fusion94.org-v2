About six weeks ago I decided to pickup a new 3d Printer. After looking at what was out there from MakerBot, Ultimaker, Type A Machines, Chinese knockoffs (like FlashForge and Wanhao) and the various models based off the RepRap Prusa,  I finally settled on the FlashForge Creator Pro Dual Extrusion 3D Printer (FFCP).

 Some of the reasons I chose the FFCP is because it's totally enclosed. This should allow for more efficient and higher quality BS prints. It has a three-point platform leveling system which is pretty intuitive. It has a  heat resistant build platform support made of highly-durable metal. And has a thicker Z-axis rod which provides for steadier  and precise movement.

### Key features and improvements:

* Sturdy metal frame is substantially more stable than the Creator's original wood frame.
* Warp-resistant 6.3mm aluminum build platform remains perfectly level under the stress of high heat.
* Heat-resistant metal platform supports replace plastic supports.
* Heavy-duty (10mm) z-axis guide rod ensures steady and precise movement.
* Acrylic cover encloses the chamber to insulate and protect ABS prints.
* LED light illuminates the build chamber.
* Integrated LCD screen and button board functions error-free.

Out of the box it required very minimal setup.  Here are the steps:

1. Set the power supply to use 115V (ships set to 230V).
2. Attach dual extruders to extruder seat using 2 hex screws (provided).
3. Attach filament spool holders.
4. Attach filament guide tube.
5. Plug in power cord.
6. Plug in USB cable type A/B.
7. Install flament onto filament spool holders.

At this point you should have something that looks a lot like this:

I'm not going to go into the details for assembeling the top enclosure as it's pretty self-explanatory. Once you've gotten that assembled and in place along with the front door you will have something that looks like this:

In the next few days I'll be writing additional blog posts related to the FFCP so stay tuned.
