So this was a sample print I did over the weekend after using my method of automatic bed leveling as described in a previous blog post.

It was printed using the following settings: Rectilinear Infill of 20%, 2 shell, no support, no raft.

The files are available [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:308335)
