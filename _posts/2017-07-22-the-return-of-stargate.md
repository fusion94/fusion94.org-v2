Color me excited...the long-running science fiction franchise Stargate will be returning later this fall with a new digital show from MGM called Stargate Origins. The announcement was made this last week at San Diego Comic-Con, during a 20th anniversary retrospective on the series Stargate SG-1.

The downside is that each episode will only be 10 minutes in length and the first season will contain 10 episodes.

Stargate SG-1 was based on the 1994 Roland Emmerich film Stargate, and followed a team of specialists who traveled through the titular portal to explore new worlds and face off against various enemies. The show ended up lasting for 10 years, and spawned the spinoffs Stargate: Atlantis and Stargate Universe. Origins will actually be a prequel to the original film.
