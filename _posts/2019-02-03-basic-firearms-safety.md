The basic tenet of firearms safety is **keeping yourself and those around you safe is your responsibility and must be your number one priority**. There are a few acronyms out there related to firearms safety.

Safety begins with these two acronyms **A.C.T.S.** and **P.R.O.V.E.**

* **A** - Assume that every firearm is loaded.
* **C** - Control the muzzle direction at all times.
* **T** - Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger until you are ready to fire.
* **S** - See that the firearm is unloaded and **PROVE** that it is safe.

* **P** - Point your firearm down range (or in the safest possible direction).
* **R** - Remove all cartridges.
* **O** - Observe the chamber(s) or cylinder.
* **V** - Verify the action or feeding path.
* **E** - Examine the bore.

Also to note are the rules of Jeff Cooper, an influential figure in modern firearms training, formalized and popularized "Four Rules" of safe firearm handling. 

* All guns are always loaded.
* Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy.
* Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target.
* Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.
